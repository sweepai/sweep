## Case Study: Bug Fixing with Sweep

Let's say you have a bug in your code: the payment link on your website doesn't work. Here's how you can use Sweep to fix it:

1. Describe the bug to Sweep: "The payment link in my website does not work. Fix the payment link in payments.ts".
2. Sweep will generate code to fix the bug. Review the code and make sure it correctly fixes the bug.
3. Once you're satisfied with the code, add it to your codebase and test it to make sure the bug is fixed.

That's it! With Sweep, bug fixing is as easy as describing the problem.
