## Go to your repository and create an issue
The issue title should start with `Sweep: ` For issues and PRs, call Sweep using the Sweep label or by prefixing your text with `Sweep: `
- **Sweep works best with real repositories and real issues.**


<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 2px solid black;">

Note: The initial startup time typically takes around 3-5 minutes depending on your codebase.

## Fix Sweep's PRs

Sweep will mess up sometimes. Comment on it's PR. (ex: "use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow".)
- You can also comment in the issue and code. See [Commenting](https://docs.sweep.dev/commenting).
- To have Sweep automatically improve it's PRs, use Github Actions. [GHA Tech Blog](https://docs.sweep.dev/blogs/giving-dev-tools)
- To disable Sweep on a PR/issue, remove the Sweep label.

## Sweep Prompting Tricks üìù

* Mention filenames or function names.
* Describe the changes or fixes you want.
* Provide any additional context that might be helpful.
* For more guidance, visit [Sweep Recipes](https://docs.sweep.dev/recipes).

## Limitations of Sweep (for now) ‚ö†Ô∏è

* üèóÔ∏è **Large-scale refactors**: >3 files or >150 lines of code changes (we're working on this!)
    * We can't do this - "Refactor entire codebase from Tensorflow to PyTorch"

* ‚è≤Ô∏è **Using the latest APIs** that have changed past 2022
    * We can't do this - "Set up a vector store using LlamaIndex Typescript"
    * üé© However if you provide the relevant docs as links/text, then Sweep will read them and make the changes.

* üñºÔ∏è **Editing images** and other non-text assets
    * We can't do this - "Use the logo to create favicons for our landing page"

* ‚§µÔ∏è **Accessing external APIs**, including fetching API tokens
    * We can't do this - "Set up sign-in using Ethereum"

## Pricing
We offer unlimited GPT3.5 tickets to every user. You also start with 5 GPT4 credits which are used when a PR is created.
