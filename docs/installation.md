# Welcome to Sweep - GitHub App installed successfully! üéâ


‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to follow these instructions in your own repository. Sweep works best with real repositories and real issues; empty or test repositories will break Sweep. *If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).*

## Create an issue on your own repository
The issue title should start with `Sweep: ` For issues and PRs, call Sweep using the Sweep label or by prefixing your text with `Sweep: `

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 2px solid black;">
      <img src="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/assets/44910023/68b345eb-0ae5-455e-a1a3-c388b1f032f6" alt="Image description">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: The initial startup time typically takes around 3-5 minutes depending on your codebase.

## Fix Sweep's PRs

Sweep will mess up sometimes. Comment on it's PR. (ex: "use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow".)
- You can also comment in the issue and code. See [Commenting](https://docs.sweep.dev/commenting).
- To have Sweep automatically improve it's PRs, use Github Actions. [GHA Tech Blog](https://docs.sweep.dev/blogs/giving-dev-tools)
- To disable Sweep on a PR/issue, remove the Sweep label.
