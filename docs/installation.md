# Welcome to Sweep - Your AI Junior Developer! 🎉

We're excited to have you on board! To get started, here's a quick guide to help you make the most out of Sweep:

Prerequisites: 
- [Install Sweep](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai)
- [Enable Issues in Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)

## Step 1: Star Sweep Repository ⭐

First, make sure to star our [open-source GitHub repo](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) to stay updated with all the latest features and improvements. We're constantly enhancing Sweep based on your feedback.

## Step 2: Best Practices 📝

To get the most out of Sweep, we recommend the following best practices. The better the input, the better Sweep's output!

Here's what a good issue might include:
* **Where to look**: Mention filenames or function names.
* **What to do**: Describe the changes or fixes you want.
* **Additional context**: Provide any additional context that might be helpful.

For more detailed guidance, visit our [Sweep Recipes](https://docs.sweep.dev/recipes).

## Step 3: Create an Issue 🐞

Create a new issue in your repository. The issue title should start with "Sweep: ".

Example: "Sweep: In sweepai/app/ui.py, use an os-agnostic temp directory".

## Step 4: How Sweep Picks Up Issues 🕵️‍♂️

Sweep only considers issues with the "Sweep:" title on creation and not on update. If you want Sweep to pick up an issue after it has been created, you can add the "Sweep" label to the issue.

## Step 5: Comment on Sweep's Pull Request 💬

If you notice any issues with the pull request, comment on the pull request with "Sweep: " and your comment. For example, "Sweep: use a different package instead".
