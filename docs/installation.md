# Welcome to Sweep! üéâ

To get started, install Sweep and enable issues in your repo:
- [Install Sweep](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai)
- [Enable Issues in Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)

## Steps to Use Sweep:

1. Star our [open-source GitHub repo](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) to stay updated.
2. Follow these best practices for creating issues:
   - **Where to look**: Mention filenames or function names.
   - **What to do**: Describe the changes or fixes you want.
   - **Additional context**: Provide any additional context that might be helpful.
   - For more guidance, visit our [Sweep Recipes](https://docs.sweep.dev/recipes).
3. Create a new issue in your repository starting with "Sweep: ".
   - Example: "Sweep: In sweepai/app/ui.py, use an os-agnostic temp directory".
4. Sweep picks up issues with the "Sweep:" title on creation. To have Sweep pick up an issue after creation, add the "Sweep" label.
5. Comment on Sweep's pull request with "Sweep: " and your comment if you notice any issues.
   - Example: "Sweep: use a different package instead".
