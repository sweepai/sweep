## Sweep Prompting Tricks 📝

* Mention filenames or function names.
* Describe the changes or fixes you want.
* Provide any additional context that might be helpful.
* For more guidance, visit [Sweep Recipes](https://docs.sweep.dev/recipes).

## Limitations of Sweep (for now) ⚠️

* 🏗️ **Large-scale refactors**: >3 files or >150 lines of code changes (we're working on this!)
    * We can't do this - "Refactor entire codebase from Tensorflow to PyTorch"

* ⏲️ **Using the latest APIs** that have changed past 2022
    * We can't do this - "Set up a vector store using LlamaIndex Typescript"
    * 🎩 However if you provide the relevant docs as links/text, then Sweep will read them and make the changes.

* 🖼️ **Editing images** and other non-text assets
    * We can't do this - "Use the logo to create favicons for our landing page"

* ⤵️ **Accessing external APIs**, including fetching API tokens
    * We can't do this - "Set up sign-in using Ethereum"

## Pricing
We offer unlimited GPT3.5 tickets to every user. You also start with 5 GPT4 credits which are used when a PR is created.
