# Welcome to Sweep - GitHub App installed successfully! üéâ


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to follow these instructions in your own repository.
Sweep works best with real repositories and real issues; empty or test repositories will break Sweep. *If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial).*

## Create an issue on your own repository
The issue title should start with `Sweep: ` For issues and PRs, call Sweep using the Sweep label or by prefixing your text with `Sweep: `

For existing GitHub issues, add the `Sweep` label to the issue.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 2px solid black;">
      <img src="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/assets/44910023/68b345eb-0ae5-455e-a1a3-c388b1f032f6" alt="Image description">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: The initial startup time typically takes around 3-5 minutes depending on your codebase.

## Fix Sweep's PRs

Sweep will mess up sometimes. Comment on it's PR. (ex: "use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow".)
- You can also comment in the issue and code. See [Commenting](https://docs.sweep.dev/commenting).
- To have Sweep automatically improve it's PRs, use Github Actions. [GHA Tech Blog](https://docs.sweep.dev/blogs/giving-dev-tools)
- To disable Sweep on a PR/issue, remove the Sweep label.

## Sweep Prompting Tricks üìù

* Mention filenames or function names.
* Describe the changes or fixes you want, optionally mentioning implementation details.
* Provide any additional context that might be helpful, e.g. see "src/App.test.tsx" for an example of a good unit test.
* For more guidance, visit [Advanced](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced), or watch the following video.

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Qn9vB71R4UM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn9vB71R4UM "Advanced Sweep Tricks and Feedback Tips")

For configuring Sweep for your repo, see [Config](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config), especially for setting up Sweep Rules and Sweep Sweep.

## Limitations of Sweep (for now) ‚ö†Ô∏è

* üóÉÔ∏è **Gigantic repos**: >5000 files. We have default extensions and directories to exclude but sometimes this doesn't catch them all. You may need to block some directories (see [`blocked_dirs`](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config#blocked_dirs))
    * If Sweep is stuck at 0% for over 30 min and your repo has a few thousand files, let us know.

* üèóÔ∏è **Large-scale refactors**: >5 files or >300 lines of code changes (we're working on this!)
    * We can't do this - "Refactor entire codebase from Tensorflow to PyTorch"

* üñºÔ∏è **Editing images** and other non-text assets
    * We can't do this - "Use the logo to create favicons for our landing page"

* ‚§µÔ∏è **Accessing external APIs**, including fetching API tokens
    * We can't do this - "Set up sign-in using Ethereum"
