# Limitations

## File Size

Previously, Sweep had a limitation on the size of the files it could handle. This was due to the way it read files into memory.

However, we've made some updates to improve this. Now, Sweep uses a streaming method in the `modify_file` function to handle larger files. This means it reads and processes the file in chunks, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.

This update allows Sweep to handle much larger files than before, making it more versatile and useful for larger projects.
