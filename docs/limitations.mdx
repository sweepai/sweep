# Limitations

## Handling Larger Files

In previous versions, Sweep bot had limitations when it came to handling larger files. However, we've made significant improvements to our `modify_file` function. It now supports larger files by streaming the code. This means Sweep bot can handle larger files than before, making it more versatile and useful for larger projects. We're excited about this improvement and hope it makes your experience with Sweep bot even better!
