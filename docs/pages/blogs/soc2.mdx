# Sweep is SOC2 Compliant and Enterprise Offering

*March 6, 2024*

We’re excited to announce that Sweep has earned SOC2 Type I compliance! This means we’ve passed a third-party audit of our internal security policies and controls that protect customer data.

The SOC2 Type I audit is globally recognized as a rigorous evaluation of information security practices. Developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), it allows third-party auditors to assess a service provider's internal controls regarding information security.

As a product that processes customer code, it’s critical to us that our customer data is protected. In our new enterprise offering, we'll deploy Sweep on your virtual private cloud like AWS, GCP, Azure, or DigitalOcean. This ensures that your code is protected and never enters our servers.

We'll also finetune our code retrieval models to your codebase. This improves accuracy by up to 20%, saving even more developer time. We also provide usage insights, Sweep progress dashboards, and custom evaluations to understand how Sweep works for your code.
