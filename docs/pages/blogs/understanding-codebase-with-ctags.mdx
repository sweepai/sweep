# **Understanding Your Codebase Using ctags**

Author: Luke Jaggernauth

In the past few weeks, we have greatly improved the performance of Sweep and I would like to share a significant piece of our journey: getting to know your codebase using universal-ctags.

## Background
In the realm of coding, understanding the structure and semantics of a codebase is key. Itâ€™s vital for pinpointing definitions, implementations, and usages of functions, classes, and variables. Traditionally, this would require manual navigation and significant familiarity with the codebase - a time-consuming process. We wanted to automate this and make it more efficient. 

## File Tree
Previously, Sweep could only see the file tree structure of the repository as well as some snippets from relevant scripts. The file tree looks similar to this:

```

[README.md](http://readme.md/)
chatRoom/
|- [README.md](http://readme.md/)
|- demo_connect.gif
|- demo_send_msg.gif
|- include/
|   |- Practical.cpp

```

However, we found that this did not provide enough adequate information about the codebase. So, we decided to include ctags as context. 

## New File Tree
Universal-ctags allows us to look through the repository with a better understanding of the code, like the location of methods, variables, and classes. With this context, Sweep can now provide intelligent context-aware assisstance. When you query about a particular function, Sweep can quickly identify it and provide relevant information about its definition and usage, enabling more accurate responses. The file tree has been updated to include the ctags:

```

.gitignore
jp-app/
|- App.xaml
|- App.xaml.cs
|   |- namespace jp_app
|   |- class App
|   |- method App (ISystemLanguageService systemLanguageService)
|   |- method OnStart ()

```

## Conclusion
We wanted to give a thank you to Paul Gauthier! [His blog](https://aider.chat/docs/ctags.html) was helpful in learning about ctags, and we're excited to further build on his approach!
Weâ€™re incredibly excited about how universal-ctags is boosting Sweepâ€™s understanding of your codebase and canâ€™t wait to share more updates! For anyone eager to learn more, check out our GitHub repo: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep ðŸŒŸ
