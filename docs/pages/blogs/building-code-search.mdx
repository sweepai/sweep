# üîé¬†**Building a Code Search Engine for an AI-powered Junior Developer**

**William Zeng** - July 9th, 2023

The last month of building Sweep has been fun. We‚Äôve dealt with countless formatting errors, irrelevant search results, and LLM hallucinations.

Sweep is an open source AI-powered junior developer. We take your codebase and provide it as context to GPT to solve small requests related to your code.

## Code Search

Code search is a key part of working with LLMs to automate programming. We used small language models to perform code retrieval(aka semantic search), which comes with several benefits (to be discussed in a later post!).

However, one shortcoming of pure semantic search is distinguishing between two similar pieces of code in a vacuum.

## Example

Take the following code snippets:

### Code Snippet **A:**

```python
access_token = os.environ.get("ACCESS_TOKEN")
g = Github(access_token)
repo_name = "sweepai/bot-internal"
issue_url = "[github.com/sweepai/bot-internal/issues/28](http://github.com/sweepai/bot-internal/issues/28)"
username = "wwzeng1"
repo_description = "A repo for Sweep"
title = "Sweep: Use [loguru.info](http://loguru.info/) to show the number of tokens in the anthropic call"
summary = ""
replies_text = ""
```

### **Code Snippet B:**

```python
g = get_github_client(installation_id)
if comment_id:
    logger.info(f"Replying to comment {comment_id}...")
logger.info(f"Getting repo {repo_full_name}")
repo = g.get_repo(repo_full_name)
current_issue = repo.get_issue(number=issue_number)
if current_issue.state == 'closed':
    posthog.capture(username, "issue_closed", properties=metadata)
    return {"success": False, "reason": "Issue is closed"}
```

### **********************Explanation**********************

It might not be clear which file is more important, but Code Snippet A is from [test_pr_diffs.py#L63-L71](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/tests/test_pr_diffs.py#L63-L71) (a test I wrote that‚Äôs no longer used), while B is from [on_ticket.py#L87-L96](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweepai/handlers/on_ticket.py#L87-L96) (our core logic for handling tickets). Since Code Snippet B is in an often used file, it is likely that this snippet will be more relevant as input to the LLM.

## Problem

How can we differentiate between these two pieces of code when they‚Äôre both so similar? They both discuss issues, repositories, and some usernames. If the user asks ‚ÄúHow can I change the username when creating an issue‚Äù it will be hard to differentiate between these two.

## Solution

The trick is a ranking model. An important piece of ranking results is the concept of ‚Äúquality‚Äù, i.e. what makes a file or snippet of code intrinsically valuable to the user.

The results from our vector search model are a list of items ([test_pr_diffs.py#L63-L71](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/tests/test_pr_diffs.py#L63-L71), [on_ticket.py#L87C1-L96C63](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweepai/handlers/on_ticket.py#L87C1-L96C63)) and similarity scores (0.65, 0.63). By combining intuition and attention to the data, we can create a ranking model that is ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù for each repository we onboard.

## Ideas

### 1. File Length

Up to a point, longer files are generally more valuable for search. A 20-line file is probably not valuable unless the user specifically asks for it. However, 2000-line config files should not be ranked much higher either.

```python
line_count_score = min(line_count / 20, 10)
```

### 2. Number of Commits

The more commits a file has, the more valuable it is. This lets us distinguish between one off tests and core logic (which should receive the majority of commits).

```python
commit_score = num_commits + 1
```

### 3. Recency of changes

The more recently a file was modified, the better.

```python
recency_score = hours_since_last_modified + 1
```

### Scoring

To get the final score, we normalize and multiply these three scores together and add the similarity score.

```python
quality_score = line_count_score * commit_score / recency_score
final_score = quality_score/max(quality_score) + similarity_score
```

This solution usually worked fine, but we saw the same unexpected files showing up often. The max normalization was not enough.

We fixed this by squashing the scores into percentiles, and then capping the increase at .25. In this case, the best result gets a .25 boost and the worst gets no boost.

This lets us avoid fetching tests and configs which seem similar, and instead fetch business logic that actually helps Sweep write code!
