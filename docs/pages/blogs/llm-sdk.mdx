Since the early days, we've used our own LLM framework at [Sweep](https://sweep.dev). Its helped us ship way faster, and we're excited to branch off this framework as it's own sdk!

SweepAgent is our building block for having an LLM handle any task. <br></br>
We‚Äôre using to thinking of LLMs as text-in -> text-out. Prompt engineering is commonly understood as ‚Äúchange your vocabulary and grammar until the LLM works‚Äù.

## Prompt Engineering

However, prompt engineering is more about optimizing your input (format and content), output, and parser such that you reliably achieve a given task.

Our SweepAgent class allows us to separate the concerns of a LLM task handler. Rather than a text-text interface, a SweepAgent takes in variables (like any other function) and transforms it to a Pydantic BaseModel.

This takes the burden of LLM unreliability away from your main code and encapsulates it with the LLM request. <br></br>
For example, if we want GPT to generate a list of cities, we can ask it to format it using these xml tags (XML is a lot more robust and costs fewer tokens):

Here's an example prompt:

```xml
Format the cities using these tags:
<locations>
City1
City2
City3
City4
</locations>
```

Say GPT generates the following response:

```xml
Sure, I can help with that. Here are the cities:
<locations>
Topeka
Omaha
</locations>
```

We can then match the inner file string using this pattern:
```python
r"<locations>(?P<locations_string>.*?)</locations>‚Äù
```

The issues don't end there though.

GPT might mistakenly format the cities in any of the following ways:

```
* Topeka
- Topeka
Topeka
file: Topeka
```

Our [`RegexExtractModel`](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/docs/sdk/src/agent.py#L17) parses this into a string, but we also need custom logic to handle the above edge cases.<br></br>
To do this, we can instantiate a `RegexExtractModel` with a `@property` decorator:
```python
class Locations(RegexExtractModel):
    locations_string: str
    _regex = r"<locations>(?P<locations_string>.*?)</locations>"

    @property
    def locations(self):
        result = []
        for line in self.locations_string.split("\n"):
            line = line.strip()
            if " " in line:
                line = line.split(" ")[-1]
            result.append(line)
        return result
```

This allows us to use the `locations` property as a list of locations, while still having the original string available for debugging.<br></br>
We can then use this to define our `FindLocationsAgent`:

```python
class FindLocationsAgent(SweepAgent):
    regex_extract_model = Locations
    system_prompt = "You are a geographer."
    user_prompt = "Tell me the midpoint between {first_location} and {second_location}. Then provide four cities near that midpoint formatted using <locations>\nCity1\nCity2\nCity3\nCity4\n</locations> tags."

find_locations_agent = FindLocationsAgent()
location_obj = find_locations_agent.handle_task(
    system_prompt_args=dict(),
    user_prompt_args={"first_location": "NYC", "second_location": "LA"},
)
```

Our main logic just has to treat FindLocationsAgent as a function that takes in two locations and returns a list of cities. We can also test the prompt, parser, and external logic separately.


## Try it out

Try it out by copying the code from https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/docs/sdk/src/agent.py or installing the package with `pip install sweep-sdk`. We'd love to hear your feedback!

In addition, we released the first version of our corresponding prompt playground at https://playground.sweep.dev!
