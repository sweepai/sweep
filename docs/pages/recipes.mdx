### To get the best performance from Sweep, we recommend the following approach to writing GitHub issues.
For harder problems, try to provide the same information a human would need. For simpler problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.

A good issue might include:

| Where to look <br/> **[file name or function name]**     | What to do <br/> **[change the logic to do this]**                                      | Additional Context (optional) <br/> **[there's a bug/we need this feature/there's this dependency]** |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In `sweepai/app/ui.py`                                  | use an os-agnostic temp directory                                                      | N/A                                                                                                 |
| In `on_comment.py`                                      | we should not fire an event                                                            | because it's possible that the comment is on a closed PR                                            |
| In the config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts` | add a third option called "env" to load the config settings from environment variables | At present, there are two options:  1. ... and 2. ...                                               |

If you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).

### Limitations:
Sweep is unlikely to complete complex issues on the first try, similar to the average junior developer. Here are Sweep's limitations(for now):
- Try to change less than 300 lines of code
- Try to modify less than 5 files
