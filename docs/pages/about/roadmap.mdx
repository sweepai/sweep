# 🗺️ Roadmap

- 🏖️ Sandbox for code execution. Sweep will be able to run any command you want it to, while developing your code. This allows:
  - Pre-commit hooks (automatic linting)
  - Deployments to staging environments
- 🧩 Repository wide changes. Sweep will break tasks down into smaller tickets, allowing it to do a lot more work.
