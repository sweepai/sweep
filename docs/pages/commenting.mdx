# ðŸ’¬ Commenting in Pull Requests

In Sweep, we use two types of comments in pull requests: general comments and file comments.

## General Comments

General comments use context to solve complex problems. If you want to suggest a change that affects multiple files or requires a deep understanding of the codebase, you would use a general comment.

## File Comments

File comments are quicker and only use the current file for context. If you want to suggest a change to a specific line of code, you would use a file comment.

## Multiple Comments in Parallel

Sweep also supports multiple comments in parallel. This means you can leave several comments at the same time, and Sweep will process them all concurrently.
