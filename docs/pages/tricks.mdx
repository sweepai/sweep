# ✨ Tricks for prompting Sweep

- 🎯 **Be specific:** Don’t write “fix typos”, "write tests" or “fix the first error”. Sweep will get confused and might crash. Put a real issue that you would like solved in your codebase, with as much detail as you would provide a junior developer.).
- 📁 **Mention important files:** To ensure that Sweep scans a file, mention the file path or name (`src/main.py` or `main.py`) in your ticket. Sweep searches for relevant files at runtime, but specifying the file helps avoid missing important details.

- ↩️ Reply to Sweep: If Sweep's plan isn't accurate, reply to the same ticket and provide instructions on what changes should be made instead.
- 🗨️ Comment on PRs: If Sweep creates a pull request with a few lines missing small changes, leave a review comment in the file where the change should be made.
