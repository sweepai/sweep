# Deployment

This document provides instructions on how to deploy the Sweep application.

## Docker Deployment

To deploy the application using Docker, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service. The `--build` option ensures that the image gets rebuilt.

Please ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine before executing the command.

## Further Information

For more detailed instructions and additional deployment options, please refer to the official Sweep documentation.
