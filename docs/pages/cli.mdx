# Setting up the Sweep CLI

Sweep CLI is a way to try out Sweep without the data entering our servers. It's a great way to get started and see how Sweep works.

<Callout type="info">This is a guide for running the Sweep CLI. To use our hosted version please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai, and to self-host the GitHub App, visit [here](/deployment).</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">Prerequisites: you need Python 3.10 and pip installed.</Callout>

<Steps>
### GitHub Personal Access Token

To allow Sweep to access your repo(s), create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Sweep%20Self-hosted&scopes=repo,workflow). Sweep will run entirely locally, and no code will be shared outside of OpenAI's API and GitHub.

Add this to your `.env` which should now look like this:

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### OpenAI API Key

Create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and add it to your `.env` file which should now look like this:
```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Install the Sweep CLI

```sh filename="terminal"
pip install sweepai
```

### Run the Sweep CLI

Create a GitHub Issue like "Add Sweep to my repo" in your repo, and run the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep run https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/issues/1
```

Alternatively, if you want to have Sweep automatically fix new issues as they are created, you can run the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sweep watch your-username/your-repo
```
</Steps>
