# Sweep CLI Installation
<Callout type="info">Prerequisites: **python 3.10, pip, an OpenAI account and a GitHub account**</Callout>

Sweep CLI is a locally running version of Sweep (no data will enter our servers).<br/>

*To use our hosted Sweep, [install here (2 min)](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai). To self-host your own Sweep, visit [deployment (15 min)](/deployment).*
<Steps>
### Install the Sweep CLI

```sh filename="terminal"
pip install sweepai
```

### Initialize the Sweep CLI

Initialize the CLI with your GitHub and OpenAI API keys:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep init
```

and follow the prompts to enter your GitHub and OpenAI API keys.

### Run the Sweep CLI

Create a GitHub Issue like [the examples in our guide](/#best-practices-for-creating-issues) in your repo, and run the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep run https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/issues/1
```

To have Sweep automatically fix newly created issues, you can also run the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sweep watch YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO
```
</Steps>
