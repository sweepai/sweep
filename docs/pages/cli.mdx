# Sweep CLI Installation
<Callout type="info">Prerequisites: **python 3.10, pip**</Callout>

Sweep CLI is a locally running version of Sweep (no data will enter our servers).<br/>
*To use our hosted Sweep, [install here (2 min)](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai). To self-host your own Sweep, visit [deployment (15 min)](/deployment).*
<Steps>
### Setup environment variables

To grant Sweep repository access create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Sweep%20Self-hosted&scopes=repo,workflow). Sweep will run entirely locally, and no code will be shared outside of OpenAI API and GitHub.<br/>
You also need to create an [OpenAI API token](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Add both to your `.env`:

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Install the Sweep CLI

```sh filename="terminal"
pip install sweepai
```

### Run the Sweep CLI

Create a GitHub Issue like [the examples in our guide](/#best-practices-for-creating-issues) in your repo, and run the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep run https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/issues/1
```

To have Sweep automatically fix newly created issues, you can also run the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sweep watch YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO
```
</Steps>
