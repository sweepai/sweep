# Sweep CLI Installation
<Callout type="info">Prerequisites: **python 3.10 and pip**. We also recommend [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#getting-started) for a ~1s install.</Callout>

Sweep CLI is a locally running version of Sweep (no data will enter our servers).<br/>

*To use our hosted version of Sweep, [install it here (2 min)](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai). To self-host your own deployment of Sweep, visit [deployment (15 min)](/deployment).*
<Steps>
### Install the Sweep CLI

```sh filename="terminal"
pip install sweepai
```

### Initialize the Sweep CLI

Initialize the CLI with your OpenAI, Anthropic and GitHub API keys:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep init
```

and follow the prompts to enter your API keys.

### Run the Sweep CLI

Create a GitHub Issue like [the examples in our guide](/#best-practices-for-creating-issues) in your repo, and run the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
sweep run https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/issues/1
```

To have Sweep automatically fix newly created issues, you can also run the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sweep watch YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO
```
</Steps>

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You have successfully set up the Sweep CLI. You can now use Sweep to help handle GitHub issues and pull requests.<br/>
To set up Sweep for your organization, see [self-hosting Sweep's GitHub App](/deployment) and [book a call](https://calendly.com/sweep-ai/founders-meeting) with us for a commercial license.

### Bonus (optional)

#### Ripgrep

Our search pipeline involves agentic search which sometimes uses Ripgrep, which you can install by running:

<Tabs items={['MacOS', 'Debian (or Ubuntu)', 'Windows', 'Cargo']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```zsh filename="terminal"
brew install ripgrep
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
With `apt-get`:
```zsh filename="terminal"
sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```
With `curl`:
```zsh filename="terminal"
curl -LO https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/13.0.0/ripgrep_13.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i ripgrep_13.0.0_amd64.deb
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
With Windows Chocolatey:
```zsh filename="terminal"
choco install ripgrep
```
With Windows Scoop:
```zsh filename="terminal"
scoop install ripgrep
```
With Winget:
```zsh filename="terminal"
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```zsh filename="terminal"
cargo install ripgrep
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

For other methods of installation, you can visit [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)

#### Eslint

If you're editing Javascript / Typescript code, our code editing agent will use your global copy of eslint. You need npm and npx installed, and you can install all the required packages with

```zsh filename="terminal"
npm i -g typescript eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-import
```

You can double check it's working with:

```zsh filename="terminal"
npx eslint --version
```

### Search Improvements using Other Search Providers

#### Cohere Rerank v3

Cohere's Rerank v3 endpoint can improve search's recall by > 5%. You can get an API key from https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys and run:

```zsh filename="terminal"
export COHERE_API_KEY=abcdefg
```

Then Sweep will use Cohere to rerank the top 100 snippets after the initial retrieval.

#### Voyage AI

Voyage AI's `voyage-code-2` embedding model achieves a 3% higher search recall compared to OpenAI's Ada v3. You can get an API key from https://dash.voyageai.com/api-keys and run:

```zsh filename="terminal"
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-abcdefg
```

Then Sweep will use Voyage AI for retrieval instead of OpenAI.

#### Self-hosted Search Providers

For connecting with self-hosted Cohere's or Voyage AI's model(s) on AWS SageMaker, contact us at team@sweep.dev.
