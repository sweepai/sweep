# Self-Hosting Sweep via Docker

<Callout type="info">This is a guide for self-hosting Sweep. If you are interested in our hosted version please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai.</Callout>

Sweep GitHub App is an air-gapped, self-hostable version of Sweep which serves many repositories at once.<br/>

Setting up the Sweep GitHub App involves:
1. Creating the GitHub App and getting a trial license key.
2. Hosting the Sweep backend on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean.

**The trial license key is valid for 14 days.** To upgrade to an enterprise license key, contact us at team@sweep.dev. Feel free to reach out to us for any help or questions.

<Steps>
### Create GitHub App

Create a [GitHub App here](https://deploy.sweep.dev/) (1 minute). This tool will guide you through the process of creating a GitHub App, create a license key, and provide you with the necessary `.env` file.

It will be named `.env.txt` and you will need to rename it to `.env` (browser security reasons). It should look something like this.

```sh filename=".env"
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PEM=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n
GITHUB_BOT_USER=sweepai-self-hosted
LICENSE_KEY=ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY
```

---

### Anthropic and OpenAI API keys

Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) add it to your `.env`:
```sh filename=".env"
...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Hosting Sweep

To host Sweep you need to run the Sweep webhook on a publicly accessible server. We recommend using a cloud provider (DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure) but you can also run it locally and use a reverse proxy like Ngrok.

*If you encounter issues please reach out to us through [Email](team@sweep.dev), [Discourse](https://community.sweep.dev/) or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues). We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @martin.*

<Tabs items={["Cloud (recommended)", "Local"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
We recommend deploying on the cloud for most users as the networking setup is easier. For this guide, we will use DigitalOcean.

##### 1. Create Instance
Recommended specs:
- OS: Ubuntu
- RAM: 32 GB
- CPU: 4 vCPUs
- Storage: 100 GB

<details>
<summary>If you do not have Docker/Docker Compose setup</summary>

```sh filename="terminal"
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```
</details>
Start the docker client if you are on Mac/Windows.

##### 2. Configure `.env` and pull Sweep
```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
vim .env
```

Copy the following from your local `.env` to your remote `.env`:

```sh filename=".env"
# Step 1
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PEM=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n
GITHUB_BOT_USER=sweepai-self-hosted
LICENSE_KEY=ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY
# Step 2
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

##### 3. Deploy the Sweep backend
```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up --build hosted
# To run in background, docker compose up --build -d hosted
```

##### 4. Update the GitHub Webhook URL

Get the IP address of your instance and add the port Sweep is deployed to (in this case, 8080):
```sh
http://YOUR_IP:8080
```

Navigating to this link should look like this:
{/* <img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step7.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" /> */}

Go to your GitHub app and update `Webhook URL` to the link above.

For user accounts:
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/
https://github.com/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```

For organizations:
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/, /YOUR_ORGANIZATION/
https://github.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/sweepai/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```
{/* <img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step9.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" /> */}

If prefer to deploy on your local machine, you can do so by following the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
docker compose pull hosted
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

#### 2. Set up the environment

Create a `.env` file with the contents from steps 1 and 2.

#### 3. Run the Docker Image

Then in the same directory, run:

```bash filename="terminal"
docker compose up hosted # Add -d to run in background
```

#### 4. Set up the Reverse Proxy

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh filename="terminal"
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Then proceed with step 4.

### You have successfully deployed Sweep!
*For enterprise support such as fine-tuning (20% performance gain), search index caching, usage tracking, and progress dashboards please contact team@sweep.dev.*

**Creating a Pull Request with Sweep**

Use Sweep by creating a new issue on the repository with a title prefixed with `Sweep:` like `Sweep: add type hints to BaseIndex.tsx`.
For more details see [how to use Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/#-how-to-use-sweep).
