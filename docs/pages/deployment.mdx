# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We recently changed our license to the&nbsp;[Elastic License V2](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license) to allow Sweep for commercial usage.*

This is the guide for self-deploying Sweep. If you would like to use our hosted version, please visit https://sweep.dev.

---

## 0. Setup

Clone the repo, create a `.env` file in the root directory, and pull the docker image.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
touch .env
docker compose pull
```

Let it pull the image (should take a few minutes) while you complete the next steps.

## 1. GitHub PAT

First decide which repo you would like Sweep to act on and place it in your `.env`.

```
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

Then, create a new GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) [here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new). Put anything in the "Token name" and select "Only select repositories" and select the repository you chose in step 0.

Then set the following permissions:

```python
Actions - Access: Read-only
Commit statuses - Access: Read and write
Contents - Access: Read and write
Issues - Access: Read and write
Metadata - Access: Read-only
Pull requests - Access: Read and write
```

## 2. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

After following one of the above sections, you should have the following environment variables:
```sh
GITHUB_PAT=github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

---

## 3. Running Sweep

Now, you can run Sweep with the following command:

```sh
docker compose up # Add -d to run in background
```

---

## 4. Using Sweep

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue on the repository with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: add type hints to BaseIndex.tsx` and watch the magic happen!

For more details on using Sweep, see our [tutorial](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial) and [advanced usage](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced) guides.

**You have successfully deployed Sweep! ðŸš€**

### Alternative Deployment via GitHub App:
If you successfully deployed Sweep, you can skip this section.

You can self-deploy Sweep as a GitHub App to serve many repos at once. This is a more complicated process, but it is more scalable and is what we use for our hosted version. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/self-hosting) and contact us at team@sweep.dev if you need help getting set up.
