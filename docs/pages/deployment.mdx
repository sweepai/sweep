# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We recently changed our license to the Elastic License V2 to allow Sweep for commercial usage.*

This is the guide for self-deploying Sweep. If you would like to use our hosted version, please visit https://sweep.ai. If you would like to develop on Sweep, check out [development](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep?tab=readme-ov-file#development).

## Video Guide (3 min 26 seconds)

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/myXAMKZI6Jk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXAMKZI6Jk "Deploying Sweep Video Guide")

After finishing the steps in the video, please complete these two steps:
- Add your GitHub App name to the secrets as `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME`
- Complete the `Set Webhook URL in GitHub` step once your Digital Ocean instance has finished deploying.

## 1. Setting up the GitHub App (5 min)

We created an app using `npm` to make it easier to set up the GitHub App. If you do not have it installed, install it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you would like ot set it up yourself, scroll down to the **Manual GitHub App Setup** section.

First, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep/self_deploy
npm install
npm start
```

Second, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and:
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button.
2. Click the green "Create GitHub App for USERNAME" button.
3. Pick where to install the app and then click the green "Install" button. This will take you to the app settings page.
4. Click the small "App settings" button.

Now, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. Once it has stopped, run the following command:

```sh
cat .env
```

You should see something like this:

```sh
WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=https://smee.io/abcdefg
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
```

Keep this terminal open, we will need the `PRIVATE_KEY` and `APP_ID` later:
```sh
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

And, please note your GitHub App name:
```sh
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
```

---

## 2. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. You will need this later. Also, if you have access to the 32k model, please set `OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=true`. If you have a beefier machine and want higher quality search, change the sentence transformers model to `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

## 3. Optimizing the Local Development Workflow on Macs

If you are experiencing slowness when running Sweep locally on a Mac, you can try the following suggestions to optimize the local development workflow:

1. Use Docker Desktop for Mac: Docker Desktop provides a native Docker experience on macOS and can improve the performance of running Docker containers. Install Docker Desktop by following the instructions [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. Adjust Docker settings: In Docker Desktop, you can adjust the resource allocation for Docker containers to improve performance. Increase the CPU and memory limits for Docker to allocate more resources to the containers running Sweep. You can access these settings in the Docker Desktop preferences.

## 4. Running Sweep Locally with uvicorn

To run Sweep locally without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for managing Python dependencies.

2. Clone the Sweep repository by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd sweep
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies using poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=https://smee.io/abcdefg
   APP_ID=123456
   PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
   SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_MODEL=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   ```

   Replace the values with the appropriate information.

6. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

7. Start the server using uvicorn:
   ```
   uvicorn sweepai.api:app --port 8080 --workers 3
   ```

   You can adjust the number of workers as needed, but it should be at least 2.

These instructions will allow you to run Sweep locally with uvicorn and optimize the local development workflow on Macs.

## 4. Using Sweep (1 min)

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: add comments to BaseIndex.tsx` and watch the magic happen!

For more details on using Sweep, see our [tutorial](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial) and [advanced usage](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced) guides.

Alternate steps:

<details>
<summary><h2>Alternative to 1: Manual GitHub App Setup</h2></summary>

<i>Only follow this section if you were unable to set up the GitHub App using the above steps.</i>

### Option B: Manual Setup (15 min)
Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) (3 minutes). You should return here after step 16(it's not as bad as it seems, most steps are optional).

Use the below as a reference:

Set the Repository Permissions (7 selected):

| Scope            | Permissions      |
|------------------|------------------|
| actions          | read             |
| checks           | read             |
| contents         | read & write     |
| commit statuses  | read & write     |
| issues           | read & write     |
| metadata         | read             |
| pull requests    | read & write     |
| workflows        | read & write     |


| Subscribe to events      |
|--------------------------|
| check run                |
| check suite              |
| commit comment           |
| create                   |
| issue comment            |
| issues                   |
| label                    |
| pull request             |
| pull request review      |
| pull request review comment|
| pull request thread      |
| push                     |
| status                   |
| workflow job             |
| workflow run             |

Put a placeholder url for now (ex: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/).
Generate a private key (it should prompt you at the top of the screen, or alternatively follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps)) and save it for later. This is your `private-key.pem` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/pem.png)

You will also need your app ID, which is the number at the top of the page. This is your `app-id` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/appid.png)

Click Install App to install it on your account or organization. Point it to a repo which you want to use Sweep on. This repo cannot be empty. If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).

<details>
<summary><h2>Alternative to 3: Deploying Locally</h2></summary>

If you do not want to deploy on the cloud and would prefer to deploy on your local machine, you can do so by following the steps below.

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull sweepai/sweep:latest
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

Create a `.env` file with the contents from steps 1 and 2. Then in the same directory, run:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 sweepai/sweep:latest
```

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `./ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Then proceed with step 4.
