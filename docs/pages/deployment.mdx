# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

We use the&nbsp;[Elastic License V2](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license) which allows commercial usage for Sweep.
This is a guide for self-hosting Sweep. If you would like to use our hosted version, please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai.

## 1. Setup

1. Clone the [sweepai/sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
3. Pull the docker image.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
touch .env
docker compose pull
```

Configure the repository Sweep should work on in `.env`.

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

We're halfway done! Pulling the image will take a few minutes, so let's complete the next steps for now.

## 2. GitHub PAT
To allow Sweep to access your repo, create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) here](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new). Sweep will run entirely locally, and no code will be shared outside of OpenAI's API.

Put `sweep` in the `Token name` and select `All Repositories` with the following permissions:

```markdown
Actions - Access: Read-only
Commit statuses - Access: Read and write
Contents - Access: Read and write
Issues - Access: Read and write
Metadata - Access: Read-only
Pull requests - Access: Read and write
```

## 3. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

After following one of the above sections, you should have the following environment variables in your `.env` file:
```sh filename=".env"
GITHUB_PAT=github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

## 4. Deploying Sweep Locally 

Now, you can run Sweep locally with the following command:

```sh
docker compose up # Add -d to run in background
```

## 5. Creating a Pull Request with Sweep

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue on the repository with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: add type hints to BaseIndex.tsx`!

For more details on using Sweep see [how to use Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/#-how-to-use-sweep).

**You have successfully deployed Sweep! ðŸš€**

### Alternative Deployment via GitHub App:
If you successfully deployed Sweep, you can skip this section.

You can self-deploy Sweep as a GitHub App to serve many repos at once. This is a more complicated process, but it is more scalable and is what we use for our hosted version. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/self-hosting) and contact us at team@sweep.dev if you need help getting set up.
