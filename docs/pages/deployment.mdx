# Deploying your own Sweep instance via Docker

*🎉 We use the&nbsp;[AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license which allows commercial usage for Sweep.*

This is a guide for self-hosting Sweep. If you would like to use our hosted version, please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai.

Sweep currently has two self-hosted versions:
1. **Watch script** (5 min): This is the easiest way to get started with Sweep. It watches a single repository for events and creates pull requests for you.
2. **GitHub App** (1 hour): This is a more complicated process, but it is more scalable and is what we use for our hosted version. If you need help setting this up, feel free to contact us at https://discord.gg/sweep.

## Watch Script

*5 minutes*

The watch script polls GitHub for events. Sweep creates pull requests for you when you make a GitHub issue and responds to pull request comments.

Setting up the watch script involves getting a GitHub PAT and OpenAI key and then running a Docker container.

### 1. Downloading Sweep

Open [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the following code in your terminal (hover over code for copy button):

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
touch .env
docker compose pull
```

1. Clone the [sweepai/sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
3. Pull the docker image.

In the `.env`, configure the repository that Sweep should work on.

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

We're halfway done! Pulling the image will take a few minutes, so let's complete the next steps for now.

### 2. GitHub PAT
To allow Sweep to access your repo, create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Sweep%20Self-hosted&scopes=repo,workflow). Sweep will run entirely locally, and no code will be shared outside of OpenAI's API.

Add this to your `.env` which should now look like this:

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<details>
<summary>
Link not working?
</summary>
If the link doesn't work, you can go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and manually set your preferred token name (e.g. Sweep Self-Hosted), and select the following permissions:
* repo (ALL)
* workflow
</details>

### 3. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

After following the above sections, your `.env` should look like this:
```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<details>
<summary>
(Optional) Disabling Telemetry
</summary>
We log user events (not user code) to improve the product, such as the # of pull requests created and merged. To disable telemetry, you can add the following line to your `.env`:
```sh filename=".env"
POSTHOG_API_KEY=none
```
</details>

### 4. Deploying Sweep Locally

Once `docker compose pull` from Step 1 is complete, you can run Sweep locally with the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up # Add -d to run in background
```

### 5. Creating a Pull Request with Sweep

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue on the repository with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: add type hints to BaseIndex.tsx`!

For more details on using Sweep see [how to use Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/#-how-to-use-sweep).

**You have successfully deployed Sweep! 🚀**

## GitHub App

*1 hour to set up*

You can self-deploy Sweep as a GitHub App to serve many repos at once. This is a more complicated process, but it is more scalable and is what we use for our hosted version. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/self-hosting) or contact us at team@sweep.dev if you need help getting set up.

Setting up the Sweep GitHub App involves
1. Downloading and creating a GitHub App.
2. Creating an OpenAI API token.
3. Hosting Sweep on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean.
4. Updating the GitHub App to point to Sweep's webhook URL.

If you need help setting this up, feel free to contact us at https://discord.gg/sweep.

Let's get started!

{/* ### Video Guide (~5 minutes)

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/qEKdqwPl7Jo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEKdqwPl7Jo "Deploying Sweep Video Guide")

After finishing the steps in the video, please complete these two steps:
- Add your GitHub App name to the secrets as `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME`
- Complete the `Set Webhook URL in GitHub` step once your Digital Ocean instance has finished deploying.

Alternatively, we have written instructions below.

--- */}

### 1. Create GitHub App

<Tabs items={['Probot (recommended)', 'Manual']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
We can create an app using `npm` to make it easier to set up the GitHub App. If you do not have it installed, install it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you would like ot set it up yourself, scroll down to the **Manual GitHub App Setup** section.

> Run this GitHub App locally! This tool is only used for creating the GitHub App, not hosting Sweep.
>

First, open a terminal and run the following commands (RUN LOCALLY):

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep/self_deploy
npm install
npm start
```

Second, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and:
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button.
2. Click the green "Create GitHub App for USERNAME" button.
3. Pick where to install the app and then click the green "Install" button. This will take you to the app settings page.
4. Click the small "App settings" button.

![image](/deployment/appsettings.png)

Now, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. Once it has stopped, open the `.env` file with a text editor in the `sweep/self_deploy` directory. You should see something like this:

```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
```

Add two variables to the end of the file:
1. GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
2. WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username,another-username

```sh filename=".env"
...
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username,another-username
```

You should have the following environment variables:
```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username,another-username
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you would like to use Sweep on GitHub organizations, please follow the steps below.

Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) (3 minutes). You should return here after step 16(it's not as bad as it seems, most steps are optional).

Use the below as a reference:

Set the Repository Permissions (7 selected):

| Scope            | Permissions      |
|------------------|------------------|
| actions          | read             |
| checks           | read             |
| contents         | read & write     |
| commit statuses  | read & write     |
| issues           | read & write     |
| metadata         | read             |
| pull requests    | read & write     |
| workflows        | read & write     |


| Subscribe to events      |
|--------------------------|
| check run                |
| check suite              |
| commit comment           |
| create                   |
| issue comment            |
| issues                   |
| label                    |
| pull request             |
| pull request review      |
| pull request review comment|
| pull request thread      |
| push                     |
| status                   |
| workflow job             |
| workflow run             |

Put a placeholder url for now (ex: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/).
Generate a private key (it should prompt you at the top of the screen, or alternatively follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps)) and save it for later.

![image](/deployment/pem.png)

Once the private key is downloaded, format it for the next step:

```sh filename="terminal"
echo -e "paste key here" | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ /\\n/g'
```

And, save the output for later in the following format:

```sh filename=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

You will also need your app ID, which is the number at the top of the page. This is your `app-id` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/appid.png)

Click Install App to install it on your account or organization. Point it to a repo which you want to use Sweep on. This repo cannot be empty. If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).

Store the following constants for later:

```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### 2. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. You will need this later. Also, if you have access to the 32k model, please set `OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=true`. If you have a beefier machine and want higher quality search, change the sentence transformers model to `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
```

After following one of the above sections, you should have the following environment variables:
```sh
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username,another-username
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
```

### 3. Hosting Sweep

Now to host Sweep you need to run the Sweep webhook on a publically accessible server. We recommend using a cloud provider like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure, but you can also run it locally and use a reverse proxy like Ngrok. For this guide, we will use DigitalOcean.

*Starting here it gets more involved so if you run into issues, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sweep) or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues) (ironic, we know!). We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @martin.*

<Tabs items={["Cloud (recommended)", "Local"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
Here's how to deploy Sweep on the cloud, which we recommend for most users since we don't need a reverse proxy.

##### 1. Create Instance
Recommended specs:
- OS: Ubuntu
- RAM: 32 GB
- CPU: 4 vCPUs
- Storage: 100 GB

##### 2. Install Docker and docker compose
```sh filename="terminal"
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

##### 3. Configure `.env` and pull Image
Start the docker client if you are on Mac/Windows.
```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
vim .env
docker compose pull
```

And copy the following into the `.env` file:

```sh filename=".env"
# Step 1
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username,another-username
# Step 2
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_DO_HAVE_32K_MODEL_ACCESS=false
```

##### 4. Launch Docker Image
```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up # Add -d to run in background
```

##### 5. Update GitHub Webhook URL

First, get the IP address of your instance, and add the port Sweep is deployed to (in this case, 8080):
```sh
http://ip:8080
```

Navigating to this link should look like this:
<img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step7.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" />

1. Copy this link to your clipboard.
2. Go to your GitHub App and paste this link into the `General` tab `Webhook URL` field.  Ensure SSL verification remains active.

<img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step9.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" />
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
If prefer to deploy on your local machine, you can do so by following the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
docker compose pull hosted
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

#### 2. Set up the environment

Create a `.env` file with the contents from steps 1 and 2.

#### 3. Run the Docker Image

Then in the same directory, run:

```bash filename="terminal"
docker compose up hosted # Add -d to run in background
```

#### 4. Set up the Reverse Proxy

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh filename="terminal"
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Then proceed with step 4.

### 4. Using Sweep

Finally, you can use Sweep by creating a new issue with a title prefixed with `Sweep:`, like `Sweep: add comments to BaseIndex.tsx` and watch the magic happen!

For more details on using Sweep, see our [tutorial](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/tutorial) and [advanced usage](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/advanced) guides. For extra deployment configurations like Azure, and Redis (coming soon!) check out our [extra self-hosting configs](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/extra-self-host).
