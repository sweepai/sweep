# Self-Hosting Sweep via Docker

*ðŸŽ‰ We use the open source&nbsp;[AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license which allows for commercial usage.*

<Callout type="info">This is a guide for self-hosting Sweep. To use a hosted version please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai.</Callout>

Sweep currently has two self-hosted options:
1. **Local Script** - This is the easiest way to get started with Sweep.
2. **GitHub App** - This is more scalable and is what we use for our hosted version.

For help setting up Sweep please contact us at team@sweep.dev.
<Tabs items={['Local Script', 'GitHub App']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
*5 minutes*

Our local script polls GitHub for events. Sweep creates pull requests for you when you make a GitHub issue and responds to pull request comments.

Setting up the local script involves getting a GitHub PAT and OpenAI key and then running a Docker container.

### 1. Downloading Sweep

Open [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the following code in your terminal (hover over code for copy button):

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
touch .env
docker compose pull
```

1. Clone the [sweepai/sweep](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep) repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
3. Pull the docker image.

In the `.env`, configure the repository that Sweep should work on.

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
```

We're halfway done! Pulling the image will take a few minutes, so let's complete the next steps for now.

### 2. GitHub PAT
To allow Sweep to access your repo, create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Sweep%20Self-hosted&scopes=repo,workflow). Sweep will run entirely locally, and no code will be shared outside of OpenAI's API.

Add this to your `.env` which should now look like this:

```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<details>
<summary>
Link not working?
</summary>
If the link doesn't work, you can go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and manually set your preferred token name (e.g. Sweep Self-Hosted), and select the following permissions:
* repo (ALL)
* workflow
</details>

### 3. OpenAI API Token

Please create an OpenAI API token at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

After following the above sections, your `.env` should look like this:
```sh filename=".env"
REPO=your-username/your-repo
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<details>
<summary>
(Optional) Disabling Telemetry
</summary>
We log user events (not user code) to improve the product, such as the # of pull requests created and merged. To disable telemetry, you can add the following line to your `.env`:
```sh filename=".env"
POSTHOG_API_KEY=none
```
</details>

### 4. Deploying Sweep Locally

Once `docker compose pull` from Step 1 is complete, you can run Sweep locally with the following command:

```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up # Add -d to run in background
```

### You have successfully deployed Sweep!
*For enterprise support such as fine-tuning (20% performance gain), usage tracking, and progress dashboards please contact team@sweep.dev.*

 To use Sweep, you can [create a new issue on the repository](#creating-a-pull-request-with-sweep). If you encounter rate limits please use the GitHub App deployment method.
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
You can self-deploy Sweep as a GitHub App to serve many repos at once.

Setting up the Sweep GitHub App involves:
1. Downloading and creating the GitHub App.
2. Hosting the Sweep backend on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean.

### 1. Create GitHub App

<Tabs items={['Probot (recommended)', 'Manual']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
We can create an app using `npm` to make it easier to set up the GitHub App. If you do not have it installed, install it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

> Run this GitHub App locally! This tool is only used for creating the GitHub App, not hosting Sweep.
>

First, open a terminal and run the following commands on your **local machine**:

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep/probot
npm install
npm start
```

Second, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and:
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button.
2. Click the green "Create GitHub App for USERNAME" button.
3. Pick where to install the app and then click the green "Install" button.

Now, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. Once it has stopped, open the `.env` file in the `sweep/probot` directory. You should see something like this:

```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
```

Add your `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` and `WHITELISTED_USERS` (your GitHub username) to the end of the file:
```sh filename=".env"
...
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username
```
If Probot fails, please follow the manual instructions instead.
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you would like to use Sweep on GitHub organizations, please follow the steps below.

Register a new GitHub App, following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) (3 minutes). You should return here after step 16(it's not as bad as it seems, most steps are optional).

Use the below as a reference:

Set the Repository Permissions (7 selected):

| Scope            | Permissions      |
|------------------|------------------|
| actions          | read             |
| checks           | read             |
| contents         | read & write     |
| commit statuses  | read & write     |
| issues           | read & write     |
| metadata         | read             |
| pull requests    | read & write     |
| workflows        | read & write     |


| Subscribe to events      |
|--------------------------|
| check run                |
| check suite              |
| commit comment           |
| create                   |
| issue comment            |
| issues                   |
| label                    |
| pull request             |
| pull request review      |
| pull request review comment|
| pull request thread      |
| push                     |
| status                   |
| workflow job             |
| workflow run             |

Put a placeholder url for now (ex: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/).
Generate a private key (it should prompt you at the top of the screen, or alternatively follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps)) and save it.

![image](/deployment/pem.png)

Once the private key is downloaded, format it for the next step:

```sh filename="terminal"
echo -e "paste key here" | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ /\\n/g'
```

And, save the output in the following format:

```sh filename=".env"
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

You will also need your app ID, which is the number at the top of the page. This is your `app-id` for step 2.

![image](/deployment/appid.png)

Click Install App to install it on your account or organization. Point it to a repo which you want to use Sweep on. This repo cannot be empty. If you don't have a good repo at hand, check out our [tutorial on running Sweep on Docusaurus](https://docs.sweep.dev/tutorial).

Store the following constants:

```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### OpenAI API key

Create an (OpenAI API key)[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys] and add it to your `.env`.
```sh filename=".env"
...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Hosting Sweep

To host Sweep you need to run the Sweep webhook on a publicly accessible server. We recommend using a cloud provider(DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure) but you can also run it locally and use a reverse proxy like Ngrok.

*If you encounter issues please reach out to us through [Email](team@sweep.dev), [Discord](discord.gg/sweep) or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues). We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @martin.*

<Tabs items={["Cloud (recommended)", "Local"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
We recommend deploying on cloud for most users as the networking setup is easier. For this guide, we will use DigitalOcean.

##### 1. Create Instance
Recommended specs:
- OS: Ubuntu
- RAM: 32 GB
- CPU: 4 vCPUs
- Storage: 100 GB

<details>
<summary>If you do not have Docker/Docker Compose setup</summary>

```sh filename="terminal"
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```
</details>
Start the docker client if you are on Mac/Windows.

##### 2. Configure `.env` and pull Sweep
```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
vim .env
```

Copy the following from your local `.env` to your remote `.env`:

```sh filename=".env"
# Step 1
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username
# Step 2
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

##### 3. Deploy the Sweep backend
```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up --build hosted
# To run in background, docker compose up --build -d hosted
```

##### 4. Update the GitHub Webhook URL

Get the IP address of your instance and add the port Sweep is deployed to (in this case, 8080):
```sh
http://YOUR_IP:8080
```

Navigating to this link should look like this:
<img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step7.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" />

Go to your GitHub app and update `Webhook URL` to the link above.

For user accounts:
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/
https://github.com/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```

For organizations: 
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/, /YOUR_ORGANIZATION/
https://github.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/sweepai/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```
<img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step9.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" />
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
If prefer to deploy on your local machine, you can do so by following the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
docker compose pull hosted
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

#### 2. Set up the environment

Create a `.env` file with the contents from steps 1 and 2.

#### 3. Run the Docker Image

Then in the same directory, run:

```bash filename="terminal"
docker compose up hosted # Add -d to run in background
```

#### 4. Set up the Reverse Proxy

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh filename="terminal"
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Then proceed with step 4.
