# Self-Hosting Sweep via Docker

<Callout type="info">This is a guide for self-hosting Sweep. If you are interested in our hosted version please visit https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai.</Callout>

Sweep GitHub App is a locally running version of Sweep which serves many repositories at once.<br/>
*To try out Sweep on a few example GitHub issues, see [Sweep CLI](/cli).*

Setting up the Sweep GitHub App involves:
1. Creating the GitHub App and getting a trial license key.
2. Hosting the Sweep backend on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean.

The license key is valid for 14 days. To upgrade to an enterprise license key, contact us at team@sweep.dev. Feel free to reach out to us for any help or questions.

<Steps>
### Create GitHub App

{/* Video Walkthrough: */}
{/* <br/> <YouTube videoId="3-n8OarC4y0" /> */}
Create a [GitHub App here](https://create-sweep-app.vercel.app/) (3 minutes). This tool will guide you through the process of creating a GitHub App, create a license key, and provide you with the necessary `.env` file.

It will be named `.env.txt` and you will need to rename it to `.env` (browser security reasons). It should look something like this.

```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
LICENSE_KEY=abcde-fghij-klmno-pqrst-uvwxy
```

If the process fails, please follow the manual instructions instead.
{/* We can create an app using `npm` to make it easier to set up the GitHub App. If you do not have it installed, install it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
> Run this GitHub App locally! This tool is only used for creating the GitHub App, not hosting Sweep.
>
First, open a terminal and run the following commands on your **local machine**:
```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep/probot
npm install
npm start
```
Second, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, and:
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button.
2. Choose which repositories you'd like to install your app on and then click "Install".
You can now stop the Probot server. Once it has stopped, open the `.env` file in `sweep/probot`. You should see something like this:
```sh filename=".env"
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
```
Add your `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` and `WHITELISTED_USERS` (your GitHub username) to the end of the file:
```sh filename=".env"
...
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username
``` */}
{/* If Probot fails, please follow the manual instructions instead. */}

### Anthropic and OpenAI API keys

Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) add it to your `.env`:
```sh filename=".env"
...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Hosting Sweep

To host Sweep you need to run the Sweep webhook on a publicly accessible server. We recommend using a cloud provider (DigitalOcean, AWS, or Azure) but you can also run it locally and use a reverse proxy like Ngrok.

*If you encounter issues please reach out to us through [Email](team@sweep.dev), [Discord](discord.gg/sweep) or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/issues). We are online, please ping us @kevin, @william, and @martin.*

<Tabs items={["Cloud (recommended)", "Local"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
We recommend deploying on cloud for most users as the networking setup is easier. For this guide, we will use DigitalOcean.

##### 1. Create Instance
Recommended specs:
- OS: Ubuntu
- RAM: 32 GB
- CPU: 4 vCPUs
- Storage: 100 GB

<details>
<summary>If you do not have Docker/Docker Compose setup</summary>

```sh filename="terminal"
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```
</details>
Start the docker client if you are on Mac/Windows.

##### 2. Configure `.env` and pull Sweep
```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
vim .env
```

Copy the following from your local `.env` to your remote `.env`:

```sh filename=".env"
# Step 1
APP_ID=123456
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=213921898f9as8f92139128989f
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.123218f182131
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6g626312b212142132121321412
GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME=sweep-example-name
WHITELISTED_USERS=your-username,other-username
LICENSE_KEY=abcde-fghij-klmno-pqrst-uvwxy
# Step 2
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

##### 3. Deploy the Sweep backend
```sh filename="terminal"
docker compose up --build hosted
# To run in background, docker compose up --build -d hosted
```

##### 4. Update the GitHub Webhook URL

Get the IP address of your instance and add the port Sweep is deployed to (in this case, 8080):
```sh
http://YOUR_IP:8080
```

Navigating to this link should look like this:
{/* <img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step7.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" /> */}

Go to your GitHub app and update `Webhook URL` to the link above.

For user accounts:
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/
https://github.com/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```

For organizations:
```txt /GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME/, /YOUR_ORGANIZATION/
https://github.com/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/sweepai/settings/apps/GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME
```
{/* <img src="/deployment/digitalocean_step9.png" alt="Skip Resources Page" /> */}
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
If prefer to deploy on your local machine, you can do so by following the steps below.

#### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to host Sweep.

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

Pull our image from Docker Hub:

```sh filename="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep
cd sweep
docker compose pull hosted
```

It may take 5-10 minutes to download the image and you can move on to the next step while it's downloading.

#### 2. Set up the environment

Create a `.env` file with the contents from steps 1 and 2.

#### 3. Run the Docker Image

Then in the same directory, run:

```bash filename="terminal"
docker compose up hosted # Add -d to run in background
```

#### 4. Set up the Reverse Proxy

We're going to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for a reverse proxy.

Sign up for an Ngrok account and install the CLI from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup. Your terminal must be in the same directory as your ngrok installation. Start the reverse proxy with `ngrok http 8080`. The second last line should say something like

```sh filename="terminal"
Forwarding  https://4d8d8bf053be.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Then proceed with step 4.
