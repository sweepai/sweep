# Sweep Assistant

This is a locally running dev tool for getting Sweep to code alongside you. All of your code will be executed locally (no external calls besides OpenAI).

## Installation
*5 minutes*
**Pre-requisites**
1. [OpenAI api key](https://platform.openai.com).
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (> v18) should be installed. If you are using a different version, you can use `npm install -g n && n 18`
 to upgrade your Node.js version.

Install the assistant by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh filename="terminal"
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sweepai/sweep/main/bin/install_assistant.sh && $(basename $SHELL) install_assistant.sh
```

Run the assistant by running `sweep` in your terminal.

{/* ### Step 1: Downloading Sweep

You can download Sweep by running the following command in your terminal in any directory:

```sh filename="terminal"
npm i sweepai
cd node_modules/sweepai
npm i
npm run build --no-lint
```

This should take a couple minutes to install. In the meantime, move onto the next step.

<details>
<summary>⚠️ If you get the error: "You are using Node.js 16.14.2. For Next.js, Node.js version >= v18.17.0 is required."</summary>

If you see this warning, you need to update your Node.js version by first installing [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Then run nvm install and rebuild:

```sh filename="terminal"
nvm i
npm run build --no-lint
```
</details>

### Step 2: Get your OpenAI key

Get an OpenAI key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to your `.env.local` (in `./node_modules/sweepai/.env.local`).

```sh filename="terminal"
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" > .env.local
```

### Step 3: Run the Tool

Now you can build the tool and this will take about 20s. Then you can start the tool with:

```sh filename="terminal"
# Run this in the same directory (should be ./node_modules/sweepai)
npm start
``` */}

## Usage (After Installation)

1. Set `Repository Path`
    - You can run `pwd` to use your current working directory.
    - (Optional) Edit the branch name to create a new branch for Sweep.
2. Select a file for Sweep to edit.
3. Add meticulous instructions for the code to edit.
4. Insert your script to running unit tests, such as `python $FILE_PATH`. $FILE_PATH refers to the current path. Click the "Run Tests" button to test the script.
    - Hint: use the $FILE_PATH parameter to only check the current file to reduce noise.
5. Click `Generate Code`.
6. Click "Reload" to reject changes, or the check mark to approve the change.
