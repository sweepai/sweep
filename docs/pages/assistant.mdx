# Sweep Assistant

Sweep is a locally running dev tool that codes alongside you. To preserve your security, Sweep will only send code to your OpenAI endpoint. If you use Azure OpenAI, all of your code will stay within your network.

## Installation (2 min)

<Callout type="error" emoji={<FaExclamationCircle style={{marginTop: 6, fontSize: 18}} />}>
**Prerequisites**
<ol style={{marginTop: 5}}>
1. OpenAI API key(https://platform.openai.com)
2. Node.js **v18+**(https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Use `npm install -g n && n 18` to use Node.js v18.
</ol>
</Callout>

Install Sweep by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs items={["npm (recommended)", "curl"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm i -g sweepai && npx sweepai build
npx sweepai
```

<details>
<summary>Having Trouble‚ùì</summary>
1. If you see a build error, you may be on version 16 of Node.js. You can upgrade to version 18 by running the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install -g n && n 18
```

2. If you see a permissions issue, you can fix it by running the following command:
```sh filename="terminal"
sudo (npm i -g sweepai && npx sweepai build)
```
</details>

You can run `npx sweepai` to start Sweep in the future. To update the assistant, run

```sh filename="terminal"
npm update -g sweepai && npx sweepai build
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="terminal"
curl -LO https://sweep.dev/install.sh && zsh install_assistant.sh
```

Run the assistant by running `sweep` in your terminal. To update the assistant, run the above script again in the same directory.
  </Tabs.Tab>

<details>
<summary>Disabling Telemetry</summary>
We collect telemetry (not code) to improve the assistant, such as the types of tasks you're asking Sweep to handle.

To disable telemetry, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_NO_TELEMETRY=true` to your `.env` in your Sweep Assistant directory.

You can find where the Sweep directory is cloned by running `which sweep`. For example, if `which sweep` yields `sweep: aliased to npm start --prefix /home/bob/sweep/platform`, then you would run:

```sh filename="terminal"
cd /home/bob/sweep
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_NO_TELEMETRY=true" >> platform/.env
```
</details>

## Usage (After Installation)

<Steps>
### Set `Repository Path`
You can run `pwd` to use your current working directory.

### Select a files for Sweep to edit
Click "Modify file" or "Create file".

### Add Instructions
Add meticulous instructions for the code to edit. You can type @ to mention a file.
{/*
### Check the Code
    - Hint: use the $FILE_PATH parameter to only check the current file to reduce noise.
    - This step is optional but highly recommended (see below). */}

### Generate Code
Click "Generate Code" to run the assistant. Then click the check mark to approve the change or the reload to reject the change.
</Steps>

## Checking your Code

We highly recommended that you add a checks to your assistant. There are two types of checks:

1. **Validation Script**: runs after every edit. We recommend using a formatter and linter to catch syntax errors and undefined variables.
2. **Test Suite**: runs after all edits are complete.

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FaInfoCircle style={{marginTop: 6, fontSize: 18}} />}>
    **Why do we need a validation script?**

    Human developers identify syntax errors using visual cues like syntax highlighting and red squiggles, which is unavailable to LLMs. The best way for LLMs to detect such errors is to use a formatter to check the syntax and a linter for catching undefined variables.

Here are some example scripts we recommend:

<Tabs items={['Python', 'Javascript / Typescript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="Validation Script"
python3 -m py_compile < $FILE_PATH
pylint $FILE_PATH --errors-only
```

```sh filename="Test Suite"
pytest $FILE_PATH
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="Validation Script"
prettier $FILE_PATH
eslint $FILE_PATH
```

```sh filename="Test Suite"
jest $FILE_PATH
pnpm run build
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Make sure to click the "Run Tests" button to test the script.

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FaInfoCircle style={{marginTop: 6, fontSize: 18}} />}>
  You may want to provide the full path to the CLI tools (e.g. `/home/kevin/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/sweepai-u_abcdefg-py3.10/bin/black`) if you are using a custom virtual environment. You may also want to run `python -m pylint` or `python3 -m pylint` instead of `pylint`.
