The goal is to prevent multiple rules from being called simultaneously. \r\n\r\nThe changes include the following:\r\n\r\n- Added a delay of at least 30 seconds before calling rules again on the given repository.\r\n- Implemented a debounce function in the `sweepai/api.py` file to handle the delay.\r\n- Updated the `call_on_merge` function to incorporate the debounce mechanism.\r\n- Ensured adherence to PEP8 coding style guidelines.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes\r\n\r\n- Added a debounce function to introduce a delay of at least 30 seconds before calling rules again on the given repository.\r\n- Updated the `call_on_merge` function to incorporate the debounce mechanism.\r\n- Ensured adherence to PEP8 coding style guidelines.\r\n\r\nPlease review and merge this PR. Thank you!\r\n\r\nFixes #1753.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nüéâ Latest improvements to Sweep:\r\n\r\n* Getting Sweep to run linters before committing! Check out [Sweep Sandbox Configs](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config) to set it up.\r\n* Added support for self-hosting! Check out [Self-hosting Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/deployment) to get started.\r\n* [Self Hosting] Multiple options to compute vector embeddings, configure your .env file using [VECTOR_EMBEDDING_SOURCE](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweepai/config/server.py#L144)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nüí° To get Sweep to edit this pull request, you can:\r\n* Leave a comment below to get Sweep to edit the entire PR\r\n* Leave a comment in the code will only modify the file\r\n* Edit the original issue to get Sweep to recreate the PR from scratch",

The goal is to prevent multiple rules from being called simultaneously. \r\n\r\nThe changes include the following:\r\n\r\n- Added a delay of at least 30 seconds before calling rules again on the given repository.\r\n- Implemented a debounce function in the `sweepai/api.py` file to handle the delay.\r\n- Updated the `call_on_merge` function to incorporate the debounce mechanism.\r\n- Ensured adherence to PEP8 coding style guidelines.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes\r\n\r\n- Added a debounce function to introduce a delay of at least 30 seconds before calling rules again on the given repository.\r\n- Updated the `call_on_merge` function to incorporate the debounce mechanism.\r\n- Ensured adherence to PEP8 coding style guidelines.\r\n\r\nPlease review and merge this PR. Thank you!\r\n\r\nFixes #1753.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nüéâ Latest improvements to Sweep:\r\n\r\n* Getting Sweep to run linters before committing! Check out [Sweep Sandbox Configs](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config) to set it up.\r\n* Added support for self-hosting! Check out [Self-hosting Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/deployment) to get started.\r\n* [Self Hosting] Multiple options to compute vector embeddings, configure your .env file using [VECTOR_EMBEDDING_SOURCE](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweepai/config/server.py#L144)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nüí° To get Sweep to edit this pull request, you can:\r\n* Leave a comment below to get Sweep to edit the entire PR\r\n* Leave a comment in the code will only modify the file\r\n* Edit the original issue to get Sweep to recreate the PR from scratch"
