It also includes some minor code improvements and fixes.\n\n# Summary\n- `chunk_string` function now has type hints for the `s` parameter and return value.\n- `remove_non_alphanumeric` function now has type hints for the `url` parameter and return value.\n- `write_documentation` function now has type hints for the `doc_url` parameter and return value.\n- `daily_update` function now has a return type hint of `None`.\n- `search_vector_store` function now has type hints for the `doc_url`, `query`, and `k` parameters, as well as the return value.\n\nFixes #2738.\n\n---\n\n### ðŸŽ‰ Latest improvements to Sweep:\n\n* We just released a [dashboard](https://progress.sweep.dev) to track Sweep's progress on your issue in real-time, showing every stage of the process â€“ from search to planning and coding.\n* Sweep uses OpenAI's latest Assistant API to **plan code changes** and **modify code**! This is 3x faster and *significantly* more reliable as it allows Sweep to edit code and validate the changes in tight iterations, the same way as a human would.\n* Try using the GitHub issues extension to create Sweep issues directly from your editor! [GitHub Issues and Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ’¡ To get Sweep to edit this pull request, you can:\n* Comment below, and Sweep can edit the entire PR\n* Comment on a file, Sweep will only modify the commented file\n* Edit the original issue to get Sweep to recreate the PR from scratch",
