You can use `os.getenv` to retrieve the `HUGGINGFACE_URL` from the environment variables.\n> • If the `HUGGINGFACE_URL` is provided, send a HTTP request to the Hugging Face endpoint with the texts to be embedded. You can use the `requests.post` function to send the request. The URL for the request should be the `HUGGINGFACE_URL` and the data for the request should be the texts. Make sure to handle any potential errors that may occur when sending the request.\n> • If the `HUGGINGFACE_URL` is not provided, the function should proceed as usual. This means the existing code in the function should be kept intact.\n\n</details>\n",
