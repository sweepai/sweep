It consists of layers of nodes, or \"neurons\", that are interconnected. Each node applies a function to its inputs to produce an output. This process is used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.\n+\"\"\"\n # Todo",

Check out [Sweep Sandbox Configs](https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config) to set it up.\n* Added support for self-hosting! Check out [Self-hosting Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/deployment) to get started.\n* [Self Hosting] Multiple options to compute vector embeddings, configure your .env file using [VECTOR_EMBEDDING_SOURCE](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/sweepai/config/server.py#L144)\n\n\n---\n\nüí° To get Sweep to edit this pull request, you can:\n* Leave a comment below to get Sweep to edit the entire PR\n* Leave a comment in the code will only modify the file\n* Edit the original issue to get Sweep to recreate the PR from scratch",
