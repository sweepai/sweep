This improves performance, especially for large files.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n- Replaced the line `if len(f.read()) > 60000:` with `if os.stat(file).st_size > 60000:` in the `filter_file` function.\n- Removed the code that reads the entire file in the `filter_file` function.\n- Updated the documentation or comments to explain the use of `os.stat()` for file size comparison.\n\nPlease review and provide feedback on the changes. Once approved, these changes can be merged into the main branch.\n\nFixes #1420.\n\n---\nTo checkout this PR branch, run the following command in your terminal:\n```zsh\ngit checkout sweep/use-os-stat-for-file-size-comparison\n```\n\n---\n\nðŸŽ‰ Latest improvements to Sweep:\n\n* Use Sweep Map to break large issues into smaller sub-issues, perfect for large tasks like \"Sweep (map): migrate from React class components to function components\"\n* Getting Sweep to format before committing! Check out [Sweep Sandbox Configs](https://docs.sweep.dev/config#sandbox) to set it up.\n* We released a [demo of our chunker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sweepai/chunker), where you can find the corresponding blog and code.\n\n\n---\n\nðŸ’¡ To get Sweep to edit this pull request, you can:\n* Leave a comment below to get Sweep to edit the entire PR\n* Leave a comment in the code will only modify the file\n* Edit the original issue to get Sweep to recreate the PR from scratch",
