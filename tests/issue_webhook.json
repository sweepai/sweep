Move the Messages class to the entities.py file. Allow this object to be indexed like a list.\r\n\r\nAlso, create a new feature for this class. Make the class support with statements. Example:\r\n```py\r\nwith self.messages.prompt(system_prompt=..., new_prompt=..., swap_prompt=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nswap_prompt will switch the system_prompt for this new one, then it will revert it back to the old one after it is complete. This implementation will likely need a new class returned by the messages.prompt function, that contains the impl of __enter__ and __exit__",
