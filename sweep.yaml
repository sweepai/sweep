description: "sweepai/sweep is a python 3.10 project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. All imports should be global (like `import sweepai.utils.github_utils`). Write unit tests in the same directory as their corresponding code, i.e. sweepai/api_test.py tests sweepai/api.py."
# These are the docs that we index for Sweep.
# We scrape these docs once a day and store them in our database.
# You can use it by adding the key to your GitHub issue.
# Example: Use PyGitHub to get the number of files in a repo.

# The title should be restrictive so it only shows up when the user wants it.
# "React JS" is good, "React" is not.
# The url should be the root of the docs, not a specific page. We will scrape all pages under this root.
# "https://react.dev/" is good, "https://react.dev/docs/getting-started" is not.
# Write a natural language description of what the package is and how it's used to help Sweep.

  github: ["https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable", "We use github to perform actions with Sweep."]
