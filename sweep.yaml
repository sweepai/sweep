description: "sweepai/sweep is a python 3.10 project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8."
# These are the docs that we index for Sweep.
# We scrape these docs once a day and store them in our database.
# You can use it by adding the key to your GitHub issue.
# Example: Use PyGitHub to get the number of files in a repo.

# The title should be restrictive so it only shows up when the user wants it.
# "React JS" is good, "React" is not.
# The url should be the root of the docs, not a specific page. We will scrape all pages under this root.
# "https://react.dev/" is good, "https://react.dev/docs/getting-started" is not.
