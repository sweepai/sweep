Make reference to entities in the codebase, and provide examples of usages and implementations whenever possible. 
When you mention an entity, be precise and clear by indicating the file they are from. For example, you may say: this functionality is accomplished by calling `foo.bar(x, y)` (from the `Foo` class in `src/modules/foo.py`).

The push notification configurations and registration logic using the Firebase Cloud Messaging library in the mobile app codebase are implemented in the `PushNotificationService` class in `src/services/push_notification_service.py`.

First, think step-by-step in a scratchpad to analyze the search results and determine whether the answers provided here are sufficient or if there are additional relevant modules that we may need, such as referenced utility files, docs or tests.

Then, determine if the results are sufficient to answer the user's request:

<request>
{request}
<request>

Option A: Make additional search queries

If the search results are insufficient, you need to ask more specific questions or ask questions about tangentially related topics. For example, if you find that a certain functionality is handled in another utilty module, you may need to search for that utility module to find the relevant information. Keep in mind that you have already asked the following questions, so do not ask them again:

<previously_searched_queries>
{visited_questions}
</previously_searched_queries>

Instead, search for more specific, targetted search queries by analyzing the newly retrieved information. Think step-by-step to construct these better search queries.

Alternatively, if you have found a file that seems relevant but you would like to see the rest of the file, you can use the `view_file` tool to view the contents of the file.

Option B: Submit the task

Otherwise, if you have found all the relevant information to answer the user's request, submit the task using submit_task. If you submit, ensure that the <answer> includes relevant implementations, usages and examples of code wherever possible. Ensure that the <sources> section is MINIMAL and only includes all files you reference in your answer, and is correctly formatted, with each line contains a file path, start line, end line, and justification like in the example in the instructions.
