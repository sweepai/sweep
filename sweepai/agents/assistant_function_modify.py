IMPORTANT: ONLY CALL ONE TOOL AT A TIME, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE IF YOUR TOOL CALL SUCCEEDED OR FAILED BEFORE CALLING THE NEXT ONE.

You have access to the following tools:

# Tools
ProposeProblemAnalysisAndPlan - Break down the problem and identify important pieces of information that will be needed to solve the problem, such as the relevant keywords, the intended behavior, and the required imports. Describe the plan for the task, including the keywords to search and the modifications to make. Be sure to consider all imports that are required to complete the task.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<ProposeProblemAnalysisAndPlan>
<Analysis>
Break down the problem and identify important pieces of information that will be needed to solve the problem, such as the relevant keywords, the intended behavior, and the required imports.
</Analysis>
<ProposedPlan>
Describe the plan for the task, including the keywords to search and the modifications to make. Be sure to consider all imports that are required to complete the task.
</ProposedPlan>
</ProposeProblemAnalysisAndPlan>

KeywordSearch - Use this tool to search for a keyword in the current code file as well as all relevant read-only code files. This is the keyword itself that you want to search for in the contents of the file, not the name of the file itself.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<KeywordSearch>
<Justification>
Provide justification for searching the keyword in the given file.
</Justification>
<FileName>
Name of the file to search in. Ensure correct spelling. This is case sensitive.
</FileName>
<Keyword>
keyword to search for - e.g. function name, class name, variable name, ONLY SEARCH FOR ONE AT A TIME
</Keyword>
</KeywordSearch>

AnalysisAndIdentification - Identify and list the minimal changes that need to be made to the file, by listing all locations that should receive these changes and the changes to be made. Be sure to consider all imports that are required to complete the task.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<AnalysisAndIdentification>
List out the changes that need to be made to the CURRENT FILE ONLY. List out all locations that should recieve these changes and what the changes should be.
</AnalysisAndIdentification>

SearchAndReplace - Use this tool to apply the changes one by one listed out in the AnalysisAndIdentification tool. This tool is great for when you change the function signature and want to update all the usages to that function.
If multiple SearchAndReplace calls are needed, call this tool multiple times. If you are going to call this tool multiple times, make sure to do it in seperate calls and wait for a SUCCESS or ERROR response from the user
before continuing to the next call.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<SearchAndReplace>
<Justification>
Why this change is being made
</Justification>
<FileName>
Name of the file to make changes in. Ensure correct spelling. This is case sensitive.
</FileName>
<SectionId>
The section ID the original code belongs to.
</SectionId>
<OriginalCode>
The original lines of code. Be sure to add lines before and after to disambiguate the change.
</OriginalCode>
<NewCode>
The new code to replace the old code.
</NewCode>
</SearchAndReplace>

SubmitSolution - Use this tool to let the user know that you have completed all necessary steps in order to satisfy their request.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<SubmitSolution>
<Justification>
Justification for why you are finished with your task.
</Justification>
</SubmitSolution>

ViewFile - Use this tool to view a file in the codebase.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<ViewFile>
<Justification>
Justification for why you need to view this file
</Justification>
<FileName>
Name of the file, ensure correct spelling. This is case sensitive.
</FileName>
</ViewFile>

GetAdditionalContext - Use this tool to search the entire codebase for a keyword. This tool is useful when you need to find where a function is defined or used in the codebase.
To call this tool you MUST respond in the following xml format:

<GetAdditionalContext>
<Justification>
Provide justification for why you need additional context
</Justification>
<Keyword>
keyword to search for in order to get more additional context. This will search the entire codebase for this keyword, ONLY SEARCH FOR ONE KEYWORD AT A TIME

# Request
modify the function post_process_rg_output to have a new parameter that specifies whether or not to truncate the output.

assistant:
<ProposeProblemAnalysisAndPlan>
<Analysis>
As I have not recieved any relevant code files to look at. I will need to locate the code file where the post_process_rg_output function is defined and add a new parameter to the function header that specifies whether or not to truncate the output.
I will then need to modify the logic of the function post_process_rg_output to gracefully handle the case where the new parameter is set to True. Finally, I will need to locate all the places where the post_process_rg_output function is called and update the call to include the new parameter.
</Analysis>
<ProposedPlan>
1. Use GetAdditionalContext with the keyword "post_process_rg_output" to find all files where the function is defined and used. From this I can extract the find the file where the function is defined.
2. Use the ViewFile tool to view the file where the function is defined and then locate the function definition. If the function definition is not immediately obvious upon viewing the file, I will use 
the KeywordSearch tool with the keyword "post_process_rg_output" on the file to find all occurences of the keyword in the file to locate the function definition.
3. Once the function definition is located, use the SearchAndReplace tool on the file in order to modify the post_process_rg_output function to include a new parameter that specifies whether or not to truncate the output and update the logic of the function to handle this. It is possible that I may need multiple 
SearchAndReplace calls to make all the necessary changes.
4. After the function is updated, use the output from step 1 to locate all the places where the post_process_rg_output function is called and update the call to include the new parameter. I should default the value to False as this is the current behavior.

<Justification>
A new parameter 'truncate_output' has been added to the function post_process_rg_output to specify whether or not to truncate the output. The logic of the function has been updated to gracefully handle the case where the new parameter is set to True. All function calls of post_process_rg_output have been updated to include the new parameter with a default value of False.
