"""Module vector_db.py

This module provides functionality for managing vector databases within the Sweep AI system. It includes classes and functions for storing, retrieving, and manipulating vector representations of data, which are essential for various AI-powered features and optimizations.

Classes:
    VectorDatabase: Represents a database for storing and retrieving vector data.
    VectorIndex: Manages indexing of vector data for efficient retrieval.

Functions:
    connect_to_vector_db: Establishes a connection to the vector database.
