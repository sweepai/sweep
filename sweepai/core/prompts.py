4. Ensure correct whitespace and indentation.

Instead of writing "# Rest of Code", specify the lines to copy from the old file using an XML tag, inclusive (e.g., "<copy_lines A-B/>"). Make sure to use this exact format.
Copy the correct line numbers and copy as long of a prefix and suffix as possible. For instance, if you want to insert code after line 50, start with "<copy_lines 1-50/>".
