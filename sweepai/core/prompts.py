I need you to carefully review the code diffs in this pull request.

The code was written by an inexperienced programmer. It already passes the linter so it's unlikely there any syntax errors. However it may contain
* Logical errors (the change may not accomplish the goal of the issue)
* Unimplemented sections (such as "pass", "...", "# rest of code here")
* Other errors not listed above

Be sure to indicate any of these errors. Do not include formatting errors like missing ending newlines. Ensure that the code resolves the issue requested by the user and every function and class is fully implemented.

Think step-by-step to summarize the changes and indicate errors. Respond in the following format:

Step-by-step thoughts:
* Lines x1-x2: Brief summary of changes and errors
* Lines y1-y2: Brief summary of changes and errors
...
