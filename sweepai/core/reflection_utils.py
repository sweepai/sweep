Provide extensive, highly detailed criteria for evaluating the contractor's performance, such as:
- Did they identify every single relevant file needed to solve the issue, including all transitive dependencies?
- Did they use multiple code/function/class searches to exhaustively trace every usage and dependency of relevant classes/functions?
- Did they justify why each file is relevant and needed to solve the issue?
- Did they demonstrate a complete, comprehensive understanding of the entire relevant codebase and architecture?

Go through the contractor's process step-by-step. For anything they did even slightly wrong or non-optimally, call it out and explain the correct approach. Be extremely harsh and scrutinizing. If they failed to use enough code/function/class searches to find 100% of relevant usages or if they missed any files that are needed, point these out as critical mistakes. Do not give them the benefit of the doubt on anything.

Evaluate the contractor from 1-10, erring on the low side:
1 - Completely failed to identify relevant files, trace dependencies, or understand the issue
2 - Identified a couple files from the issue description but missed many critical dependencies 
3 - Found some relevant files but had major gaps in dependency tracing and codebase understanding
4 - Identified several key files but still missed important usages and lacked justification
5 - Found many relevant files but missed a few critical dependencies
6 - Identified most key files and dependencies but still had some gaps in usage tracing
7 - Found nearly all relevant files but missed a couple edge case usages or minor dependencies
8 - Exhaustively traced nearly all dependencies with robust justification, only minor omissions
9 - Perfectly identified every single relevant file and usage with airtight justification 
10 - Flawless, absolutely exhaustive dependency tracing and codebase understanding

9-10: Flawless work exhaustively using code/function/class searches to identify 100% of necessary files and usages!
5-8: You failed to search for [X, Y, Z] to find all usages of [class/function]. You need to understand [A, B, C] dependencies.
1-4: You need to search for [X, Y, Z] classes/functions to find actually relevant files. You missed [A, B, C] critical dependencies completely.

<judgement_on_task>
The contractor did an outstanding job identifying all of the relevant files needed to resolve the payment processing issue. They correctly identified the core Payment.java model where the payment data is defined, and used extensive code searches for "Payment", "pay", "process", "transaction", etc. to exhaustively trace every single usage and dependency.

They found the PaymentController.java and PaymentService.java files where Payment objects are created and processed, and justified how these are critical for the payment flow. They also identified the PaymentRepository.java DAO that interacts with the payments database.

The contractor demonstrated a deep understanding of the payment processing architecture by tracing the dependencies of the PaymentService on external payment gateways like StripeGateway.java and PayPalGateway.java. They even found the PaymentNotificationListener.java that handles webhook events from these gateways.

To round out their analysis, the contractor identified the PaymentValidator.java and PaymentSecurityFilter.java as crucial parts of the payment processing pipeline for validation and security. They justified the relevance of each file with clear explanations tied to the reported payment bug.

No relevant files seem to have been missed. The contractor used a comprehensive set of searches for relevant classes, functions, and terms to systematically map out the entire payment processing codebase. Overall, this shows an excellent understanding of the payment architecture and all its nuances.

Example 2 (Score: 4): 
<judgement_on_task>
The contractor identified the UserAccount.java file where the login bug is occurring, but failed to use nearly enough code/function/class searches to find many other critical files. While they noted that LoginController.java calls UserAccount.authenticateUser(), they didn't search for the "authenticateUser" function to identify LoginService.java which orchestrates the login flow.  

They completely missed using searches for the "UserAccount" class, "credentials", "principal", "login", etc. to find the UserRepository.java file that loads user data from the database and many other files involved in authentication. Searching for "hash", "encrypt", "password", etc. should have revealed the critical PasswordEncryptor.java that handles password hashing.

The contractor claimed UserForgotPasswordController.java and UserCreateController.java are relevant, but failed to justify this at all. These files are not directly related to the login bug.

In general, the contractor seemed to stumble upon a couple relevant files, but failed to systematically trace the login code path and its dependencies. They showed a superficial and incomplete understanding of the login architecture and process. Many critical files were completely missed and the scope was not properly focused on login.

Example 3 (Score: 2):
<judgement_on_task>
The files identified by the contractor, like index.html, styles.css, and ProductList.vue, are completely irrelevant for resolving the API issue with product pricing. The front-end product list display code does not interact with the pricing calculation logic whatsoever.

The contractor completely failed to focus their investigation on the backend api/products/ directory where the pricing bug actually occurs. They did not perform any searches for relevant classes/functions like "Product", "Price", "Discount", etc. to find the ProductController.java API endpoint and the PriceCalculator.java service it depends on.

Basic searches for the "Product" class should have revealed the Product.java model and ProductRepository.java database access code as highly relevant, but these were missed. The contractor failed to demonstrate any understanding of the API architecture and the flow of pricing data from the database to the API response.

The contractor also did not look for any configuration files that provide pricing data, which would be critical for the pricing calculation. They did not search for "price", "cost", etc. in JSON or properties files.

Overall, the contractor seemed to have no clue about the actual pricing bug or the backend API codebase. They looked in completely the wrong places, failed to perform any relevant code/function/class searches, and did not identify a single relevant file for the reported bug. This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the pricing feature and backend architecture.

The contractor identified most of the key files involved in the user profile update process, including UserProfileController.java, UserProfileService.java, and UserProfile.java. They correctly traced the flow of data from the API endpoint to the service layer and model.

However, they missed a few critical dependencies. They did not search for "UserProfile" to find the UserProfileRepository.java DAO that loads and saves user profiles to the database. This is a significant omission in their understanding of the data persistence layer.

The contractor also failed to look for configuration files related to user profiles. Searching for "profile" in YAML or properties files should have revealed application-profiles.yml which contains important profile settings. 

While the contractor had a decent high-level understanding of the user profile update process, they showed some gaps in their low-level understanding of the data flow and configuration. They needed to be more thorough in tracing code dependencies to uncover the complete set of relevant files.

Great work on this optimization task! Your code changes have significantly improved the efficiency of the database queries. A few minor suggestions for further enhancement:

1. Consider using a parameterized query on line 95 of `queries.py` to avoid potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
2. The `get_user_data` function in `utils.py` could benefit from some additional error handling to gracefully deal with potential edge cases, such as a user ID not being found.

Example 2:

<judgement_on_task>
The contractor has made an attempt to implement the new feature for generating PDF reports, but there are several gaps and issues in their code changes. While they have correctly added a new endpoint for triggering the report generation, the actual PDF creation logic is incomplete. The code is currently missing the necessary imports for the PDF library, and there are several undefined variables and functions being used. Additionally, the error handling is insufficient, which could lead to uncaught exceptions. The contractor has also not included any unit tests to verify the functionality of the new feature. More work is needed to fully satisfy the requirements and ensure a reliable, maintainable solution.

<overall_score>5</overall_score>

<message_to_contractor>
Thank you for your efforts on implementing the PDF report feature. However, there are several areas that need improvement:

1. Add the necessary imports for the PDF library at the top of `report_generator.py`. Currently, the `import pdf_lib` statement is missing.
2. Implement the missing `generate_pdf` function that is currently being called on line 42 of `report_generator.py`. This function should contain the core logic for creating the PDF report.
3. Fix the undefined variables `report_data` and `user_id` in the `generate_report` endpoint. Ensure that these variables are properly initialized before being used.
4. Add proper error handling to the `generate_report` endpoint to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during the PDF generation process.
5. Write unit tests for the new feature to verify its functionality and catch any potential bugs.

Please address these issues and resubmit your code changes for further review.

Example 3:

<judgement_on_task>
The contractor's submission for the task of implementing a new user authentication system is severely lacking and does not meet the requirements. The code changes are minimal and do not include any of the core functionality needed for user registration, login, or password hashing. The contractor has merely added a few empty functions and commented out some existing code, without any actual implementation. There are no changes made to the database schema to support storing user credentials securely. The submission also introduces several syntax errors and undefined variables, indicating a lack of basic coding proficiency. Overall, this submission falls far short of the expected solution and does not demonstrate any meaningful progress towards completing the task.

<overall_score>2</overall_score>

<message_to_contractor>
I regret to inform you that your submission for the user authentication task is unacceptable and requires significant improvement. The following critical issues must be addressed:

1. Implement the core functionality for user registration, including validating input data, securely storing user credentials in the database, and handling duplicate username/email scenarios.
2. Add the necessary code for user login, including verifying the provided credentials against the stored data and generating a secure authentication token upon successful login.
3. Integrate a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or scrypt, to store and compare passwords instead of storing them in plain text.
4. Update the database schema to include the required tables and fields for storing user information and authentication data.
5. Fix all syntax errors and undefined variables in your code. Ensure that your code is free of basic compilation errors before submitting.

I recommend reviewing the task requirements carefully, studying best practices for user authentication, and taking the time to implement a complete and secure solution. If you need further guidance or clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
