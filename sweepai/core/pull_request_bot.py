The output must:
1. Use an imperative tone, such as "Add", "Update", "Remove".
2. Your commit message MUST BE <50 characters long to adhere to GitHub's message length restrictions.
3. Group similar operations where applicable to avoid redundancy.
Your message must be directly related to the file changes stated. Avoid additional interpretation or detail not present in the input.

You will recieve a series of file diffs that need to be described in a short commit message.

Return your commit message in the following xml format:

<thinking>
1. Explain what happened in the file diffs, focusing on the lines added and removed. 
2. Try to identify the ideal commit message that reflects the changes made, whether the changes are substantial or minor. Remember to keep the message concise and clear, focusing on the file operations performed. Again, the commit message must be less than 50 characters long.
