# 1. Issue Analysis:
<issue_analysis>
a. Identify potential root causes and fixes for the user comment left on the pull request by referencing specific code entities in the relevant files. Then, select which of the root causes will most likely resolve the user's comment based on the current state of the pull request and codebase. (write at least 1 paragraph)

b. Detail ALL of the changes that need to be made to the pull request (excluding tests) to resolve the user's comment. For each of the sub requests here write a detailed set of code changes spanning at least one change, possibly more. Be specific and direct, using the phrases "add", "replace", and "remove". Be complete and precise. You must address all the following subrequests and you must cover ALL changes that are required per sub request.

# Issue Sub Requests

Reference the provided code files, summaries, entity names, and necessary files/directories. The format should be:
<issue_and_proposed_changes>
<issue_sub_request>

<proposed_changes>
For each of the sub requests here, pinpoint the exact places to make changes. Describe exactly what to do, referencing specific code entities in the relevant files.
Break the above steps up into seperate actionable steps and number them.
Double check the state of the code base.
Example:
1. Step 1

   - Step 1b
2. Step 2
   - Step 2a

Based on the answers to the above question go through each of the guidelines below and see which are applicable in your case. To show that you have correctly identified the correct guidelines to follow you will
respond back with the selected guidelines.
Guidelines to follow:
<guidelines>
- If the task is a new feature, the plan should not impact existing features whenever possible and should not introduce new bugs. The plan should split the required code modifications into small easy changes.
- If the task is a bug fix, the plan should avoid making large changes and aim to keep existing logic flows intact. The plan should split the required code modifications into small easy changes.
- If the task is related the creation/addition of new unit tests, the plan should attempt to one shot the changes. That is, generate all unit tests in one go instead of splitting the changes into multiple steps.
- Use multiple <modify> blocks for the same file if there are multiple distinct changes to make in that file, such as for imports.
- A <modify> block must contain exactly one change in one <new_code> tag.
- To remove code, replace it with empty <new_code> tags.
- Never leave todo or placeholder comments like "# rest of code" in the code. Always fully implement the changes.

</selected_guidelines_to_follow>

# Plan Creation
Now based on the selected guidelines you are to return the final plan.
Plan: Write all necessary code changes to resolve the issue, indicating which code sections to modify and how to modify it.
    - When modifying code you MUST do the following:
        - First, copy the original code in <original_code> tags, copying them VERBATIM from the file. Do NOT paraphrase or abbreviate the source code. Placeholder comments like "# existing code" are not permitted. The <original_code> block must NOT be empty. Start from the last header like a function or class definition and include the entire block of code that needs to be modified.
        - Next, write the new code in <new_code> tags, specifying necessary imports and referencing relevant type definitions, interfaces, and schemas. BE EXACT and COMPLETE as this code will replace the mentioned <original_code>.
    - When creating files you MUST do the following:
        - First, describe in detail EVERYTHING you will need in this file. Skip writing <original_code> tags.
        - Next, write the new file in <new_code> tags, specifying necessary imports and referencing relevant type definitions, interfaces, and schemas. BE EXACT and COMPLETE as this file will be created in the mentioned <file_path>.
    - In both cases, paraphrasing, abbreviating the source code, or placeholder comments such as "# rest of code" are NEVER PERMITTED. NEVER LEAVE COMMENTS DESCRIBING WHAT YOU WILL DO, JUST DO IT.
    - Remember that when you are creating your plan, the changes will be applied IN ORDER meaning that if you create a file in the first <modify> block, you must consider the file created in second <modify> block meaning that if you are modifying the newly created file, you must now include the correct <original_code> block.

Respond with the following xml format for the plan:
<plan>  
<modify file="file_path"> 
Describe ALL changes to be made. Implement all the changes FULLY. This means that under no circumstances should you leave any placeholder comments like "# rest of code" or "# rest of test cases". If you find yourself doing this you MUST rewrite the plan so that this doesn't happen.

1. If you are creating a file, you may skip this step. Otherwise, copy the original code into <original_code></original_code> tags, copying them VERBATIM from the file. Do NOT paraphrase or abbreviate the source code. Placeholder comments like "# existing code" are not permitted. The referenced original code span should be just enough to cover the change, with 5 extra lines above and below for context. Start from the last header like a function or class definition and include the entire block of code that needs to be modified.

2. Write the new code in <new_code></new_code> tags, specifying necessary imports and referencing relevant type definitions, interfaces, and schemas. BE COMPLETE as this code will replace the mentioned <original_code></original_code>. Paraphrasing, abbreviating the source code, or placeholder comments such as "# rest of code" are NEVER PERMITTED.
