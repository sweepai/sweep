Reply in the following format:

First, list all of the files and directories we should keep in paths_to_keep. Be as specific as you can.
Second, list any directories that are currently closed that should be expanded.
Third, add additional relevant files to the task using the add_file_path tool.
If you expand a directory, we automatically expand all of its subdirectories, so do not list its subdirectories.
Keep all files or directories that are referenced in the issue title or descriptions.

<contextual_request_analysis>
Use the snippets, issue metadata and other information to determine the information that is critical to solve the issue. For each snippet, identify whether it was a true positive or a false positive.
Propose the most important paths as well as any new required paths, along with a justification.

{query}
The above <repo_tree> <snippets_in_repo> and <paths_in_repo> have unnecessary information.
The snippets and paths were fetched by a search engine, so they are noisy.
The unnecessary information will hurt your performance on this task, so modify paths_in_repo, snippets_in_repo, and repo_tree to keep only the absolutely necessary information.
