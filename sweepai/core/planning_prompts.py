# openai prompt
openai_files_to_change_prompt = """Your job is to write a high quality, detailed, step-by-step plan for an intern to help resolve a user's GitHub issue.

You will analyze the provided code files, repository, and GitHub issue to understand the requested change. Create a step-by-step plan for an intern to fully resolve the user's GitHub issue. Give extremely detailed instructions for updating the code logic, as the intern is unfamiliar with the codebase.

## Guidelines

- Always include the full file path and reference the provided files.
- Prioritize using existing code and utility methods to minimize writing new code and specify all necessary imports.
- Break the task into small steps, with each <modify> section for each logical code block worth of change. Use multiple <modify> blocks for the same file if there are multiple distinct changes to make in that file.
- To remove code, replace it with empty <new_code> tags.

## Instructions

You will complete the following steps.

### 1. Issue Analysis:

a. Identify extremely specific potential root causes of the issue by pinpointing the exact potential lines of code causing the issue. Then, select which of the root causes the user is most likely to be interested in resolving based on the current state of the codebase. (1 paragraph)

b. Detail ALL of the changes that need to be made to the codebase (excluding tests) to resolve the user request. For each of the excerpts here, CRITICALLY think step-by-step about the best way to make the change based on the issue description. Then, write a detailed set of code changes spanning at least one change, with possibly more depending on the preceding excerpt. List all imports required. Be complete and precise. You must cover ALL changes that are required per excerpt.

Here are the excerpts:
{issue_excerpts}

c. Detail ALL changes that do not correspond to an excerpt from the user's issue. These changes should be necessary to resolve the issue but are not explicitly mentioned in the user's request. This code change should describe exactly what to do, referencing specific code entities in the relevant files. (optional)

### 2. Plan:

List all files that need to be changed in the codebase.

For each file to modify, first, write a detailed description of the changes you are going to make, making reference to entities. Then, copy the original code in <original_code> tags, and write the new updated code in <new_code> tags. If imports are needed, they should be in a separate <modify> block. Use multiple <modify> blocks for the same file to separate distinct changes.

## Format

You will complete the above instructions by following this XML format:

### 1. Issue Analysis:
<issue_analysis>
a. Root cause analysis

b. All changes required to resolve the issue. Follow this format:

<issue_and_proposed_changes>
<issue_excerpt>
...
</excerpt_from_issue>
<proposed_changes>
1. List of proposed changes for each excerpt. If this has already been addressed, leave this blank.
...
</proposed_changes>
</issue_and_proposed_changes>

c. Additional changes
</issue_analysis>

### 2. Plan:
<plan>  
<modify file="file_path_1"> 
Instructions for modifying one section of the file, with a detailed description of the changes you are going to make.

<original_code>
The original code that needs to be modified.
</original_code>

<new_code>
The new updated code with the desired changes incorporated.
</new_code>
