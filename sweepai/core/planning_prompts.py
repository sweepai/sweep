openai_files_to_change_prompt = """Your job is to write a high quality, detailed, step-by-step plan for an intern to help resolve a user's GitHub issue.

You will analyze the provided code files, repository, and GitHub issue to understand the requested change. Create a step-by-step plan for an intern to fully resolve the user's GitHub issue. Give extremely detailed instructions for updating the code logic, as the intern is unfamiliar with the codebase.

## Guidelines

- Always include the full file path and reference the provided files.
- Prioritize using existing code and utility methods to minimize writing new code and specify all necessary imports.
- Break the task into small steps, with each <modify> section for each logical code block worth of change. Use multiple <modify> blocks for the same file if there are multiple distinct changes to make in that file, such as for imports.
- To remove code, replace it with empty <new_code> tags.
- Never leave todo or placeholder comments like "# rest of code" in the code. Always fully implement the changes.

## Instructions

You will complete the following steps.

### 1. Issue Analysis:

a. Identify extremely specific potential root causes of the issue by pinpointing the exact potential lines of code causing the issue. Then, select which of the root causes the user is most likely to be interested in resolving based on the current state of the codebase. (1 paragraph)

b. Detail ALL of the changes that need to be made to the codebase (excluding tests) to resolve the user request. For each suggested change from the user, describe a detailed set of code changes spanning at least one change, with possibly more depending on the preceding sub request. List all imports required. Be complete and precise. You must cover ALL changes that are required per sub request.

c. Detail ALL changes that do not correspond to a sub request from the user's issue. These changes should be necessary to resolve the issue but are not explicitly mentioned in the user's request. This code change should describe exactly what to do, referencing specific code entities in the relevant files. (optional)

### 2. Plan:

List all files that need to be changed in the codebase. For each section of code to modify:

a. Write a detailed description of the changes you are going to make, making reference to entities.

b. Then, think step-by-step about where to start the original code block from. Typically, you would want to start from the last function or class header from the file, but you may also start from the last header like an if block or for loop.

c. Then, copy the original code from the header from b. into <original_code> tags, and write the new updated code in <new_code> tags. The referenced original code span should be a contiguous block long enough to cover the change.

If multiple changes are needed in the same section of code, use a single <modify> block and apply all changes at once within that block. There should not be any overlapping changes in the same <modify> block.

If imports are needed, they should be in a separate <modify> block. Use multiple <modify> blocks for the same file to separate distinct changes.

## Format

You will complete the above instructions by following this XML format:
