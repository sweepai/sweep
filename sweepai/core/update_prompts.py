Modify the snippets above according to the request writing REPLACE statements or APPEND statements.
* Keep whitespace and comments.
* Write minimal diff hunks to make changes to the snippets. Only write diffs for lines that should be changed.
* Write multiple small changes instead of a single large change.
* Use APPEND to add code after the snippet.

Extract code verbatim from the snippets above. These snippets will be used later to refactor the code according to the user request.
