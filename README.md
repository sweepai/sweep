<b>Sweep</b> is an AI junior developer that transforms bug reports & feature requests into code changes.

Describe bugs, small features, and refactors like you would to a junior developer, and Sweep:
1. 🔍 reads your codebase
2. 📝 plans the changes
3. ⚡**writes a pull request with code**⚡

### Features 🌠
* Turns issues directly into pull requests (without an IDE)
* Addresses developer replies & comments on its PRs
* Uses embedding-based code search
* Fixes PRs based on GitHub Actions feedback
* Large File Support using File Streaming

[Demo](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/assets/44910023/365ec29f-7317-40a7-9b5e-0af02f2b0e47)

## Getting Started 🚀

Install Sweep by adding the [**Sweep GitHub app**](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your desired repositories.

* For more details, visit our [✨ Installation](docs/installation.md) page.

* We support all languages GPT-4 supports, including Python, JS/TS, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.

## Story 📘

We were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.

Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.

## The Stack 📚
- GPT-4 32k 0613 (default)
- ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as our embeddings model
- Modal Labs for infra + deployment
- Gradio for Sweep Chat

## Highlights 🌟
Examine pull requests created by Sweep [here](https://docs.sweep.dev/examples).

## Pricing
* We charge $240/month for 120 GPT-4 tickets per month.
* For unpaid users, we offer 5 free GPT-4 tickets per month.
* We also offer unlimited GPT-3.5 tickets.
