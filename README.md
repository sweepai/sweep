## Quickstart Guide

Sweep is an AI junior developer that can help you with your coding tasks. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Sweep:

1. Install Sweep by following the instructions in the 'Installation' section.
2. Once installed, you can use Sweep to create tickets for your coding tasks. For example, if you have a non-working payment link on your website, you can ask Sweep to create a ticket for this issue.
3. To do this, simply describe the issue to Sweep in natural language. For example, you might say "The payment link in my website does not work. Fix the payment link in payments.ts".
4. Sweep will then create a ticket for this issue and generate a plan to fix it.
5. You can review the plan and make any necessary adjustments. Once you're happy with the plan, you can ask Sweep to implement it.
6. Sweep will then make the necessary changes to your code and create a pull request for you to review.

Here's an example of how you might use Sweep to fix a non-working payment link:

1. Describe the issue to Sweep: "The payment link in my website does not work. Fix the payment link in payments.ts".
2. Sweep creates a ticket for the issue and generates a plan to fix it.
3. Review the plan and make any necessary adjustments.
4. Ask Sweep to implement the plan.
5. Sweep makes the necessary changes to the 'payments.ts' file and creates a pull request.
6. Review the pull request and merge the changes if you're happy with them.

And that's it! You've just used Sweep to fix a non-working payment link on your website.
